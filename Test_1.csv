1603,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Nice graphics, new maps, weapons and models. But developers should listen to the customers a bit more. Developers you are focused too much on things that are not important at all. You should focus on changing the tick rate of the match making servers to 128 and improving VAC a lot. Those two are what customers really want and you should focus on. Not stickers, UI and HUD changes or skins. And stop messing around with the weapons."
1604,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"I would not recommend getting into this at its current state. CSGO has hit rock bottom with Valve's missed promises of game changing updates and their lack of effort to combat the terrible cheating problem. Bugs have been in the game for years and still haven't been fixed. Cheating is out of control. Over the past few years of playing, cheating has gotten worse and worse to the point now where I end up playing against a cheater almost every game. Valve implemented the new ""trust"" matchmaking system to combat some of these issues but its lackluster algorithm still somehow thinks putting me, with years of gameplay and 3,000+ hours, against people playing on brand new accounts makes sense. I really don't know why I still put the effort to play this game anymore because it usually just ends up with me regretting it. I guess I just wish I could somehow have the fun I used to have playing this game but it seems those days are long gone."
1605,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Edit 11/12/18I have tried playing CS:GO recently and it has only dramatically gotten worse, now players are openly and obviously cheating, and even saying it in chat about walls and aims, people are clean spraying through walls even in DM and Casual far beyond what they used to.Now we know just how many cheaters there were on the game to begin with since CS:GO is now F2P, its a playground for hackers and Valve do not care.I am never buying another Valve game again, they dont care about the game or their players they just want the money.OriginalI've Played CS:GO since release and enjoyed it for a time but now sadly im uninstalling it forever. So many hackers and smurfs and yes even in PRIME, hackers are being more careful yes but a lot don't even try to hide it having 100% walls and aim getting headshots through smokes and walls, knowing exactly where you are getting 180 headshots through smokes and yes the dreaded SPIN BOT.can't do it anymore, pointless.*There are too many hackers in the game and there is no anti-cheat, no instead the developers have created overwatch where the players decide if someone is hacking leaving hundreds of hackers still in the game and also banning real players who aren't cheating forcing them to buy the game again or move to another one.*Prime does not work as there are phone number generators online so hackers and smurfs can enter prime by using a temporary phone number and verification key to get prime and hassle other Prime players.*The community is toxic, throwing insults about♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥peoples mothers and wishing peoples families to die of Cancer, and it's even worse for girls.*Some players mainly smurfs sometimes want to derank or troll so you will find multiple games where players are deliberately playing badly, messing about, team killing, not planting, telling the enemy team your positions.*So many smurfs on enemy teams can prevent you from ranking up even with a skill group as you may be GN-LE and hit smurfs that will openly admit they are global and just smurfing and you will lose those games unless you're with a good team.- This also means new players have little chance of ranking up as a lot of the GN players are smurfs from DMG to global.*There are now nowhere near the same amount of players on CSGO than there were last year because of the points I have made and because of the release of Rainbow Six: Seige.(If you want to see the value of the community in CS:GO simply look at the comments on this review lol, just insults not information or feedback about the review.)CS:GO - Flex banned on ESEA Livestream!https://youtu.be/Cq5Z53q_Se8CS:GO - Hackers VAC Banned Livehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l5S6EKmkPMCS:GO Player Recieves Death Threats After Losing (Betting)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K59PZKyzWA5 Most Awkward CSGO Pro Banshttps://www.redbull.com/gb-en/the-top-5-most-awkward-cs-go-pro-bans*I also highly recommend Personal Lifeguards review which covers a lot more points that I missed out.https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aldanukhar/recommended/730/ "
1606,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"The game is great. But the community is the worst.If you're into a match with a russian, maybe it's fine, most of the times not. But when there's a bunch of them, expect the worst. And I literally mean it.If you do something thing wrong, no matter how small it is, they yell at you angrily with their language. No matter if you're the top fragger or when they're on the lowest."
1607,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong.Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value. One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself. The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does. Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this. I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.On to why the game is good.The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game. Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter. There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you. Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating. You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into."
1608,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive! What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good!Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh! NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest.  I  learned to ignore it.  Loving the mute button!  I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad. As an example this cs:go soundboard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLpeX4RRo28 "
1609,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Since an old fan of Halo games i find, CS:GO a nice sequel to the franchise. You can jump with p90, AWP or AK and make headshots, like a true spartan.I like it, since with p90 is so ez that i'm eagle right now and i'm going supreme easly, only thanks to this weapon.Then the real DLC that this game deserve: The russians. Halo had no russian, and this game is full of it. Since the game is so easy that is more hard to play in silver levels than in eagle levels, the Russians make the game quite challenging. Like when you got one in your team, you know that the game will be a thug battle.(Just kidding Love y'all! <3)Thanks Valve for the best Hal.. ehm CS you have ever made."
1610,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013,"Hepimiz küçüklüğümüzde Counter Strike oyunlarından birini muhakkak oynamışızdır, Counter'ın yenilenen bu sürümünde Silah Yarışı başta olmak üzere Ölüm Oyunu, Rekabetçi vb gibi modlar var bunlar ana olanlar. Rekabetçi modunda bildiğimiz bomba kurup veya diğer takımın tüm üyelerini öldürme olayı var, ama sonunda size güzel hediyeler verebiliyor, ve arkadaşlarınızla takım oluşturup rekabetçide diğerlerine karşı yarışabiliyorsunuz. Oyunun marketi de değerli olabiliyor, örneğin rekabetçiden kazandığım bir silah şu an CS GO'nun pazarında 5 dolara tekabül ediyor. Eğer şansınız iyiyse gelen silahların bazılarını kullanıp bazılarını değerlendirerek oyunun tadını çıkarabilirsiniz. Silah Yarışında ise oyundaki tüm silahlarını kullanarak bıçağa doğru ilerliyorsunuz ve verilen her silahla bir kişi öldürmeniz gerekiyor o silahla bir kişi öldürdüğünüzde diğer silaha geçiyorsunuz ve bu bıçağa kadar böyle gidiyor, bıçakta ise en son öldürdüğünüzde modu tamamlamış oluyorsunuz. Eğlenceli. 1.6'dan iyi."
1611,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet."
1612,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"One of the worst communities in gaming. Griefers, cheaters, squeaky kids, flamers... Theres every type of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that you could possible think of. Every 4th match is a cheater, every 2nd match u get griefers and every single, i mean EVERY single ♥♥♥♥ing match you'll see a flamer in your team constantly trying to kick you or just bully you into leaving by abusing the voice chat. The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem:1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs)2.If you have the least amount of kills. Degenerates don't ♥♥♥♥ing get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard.3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score.4.Along with these, every ♥♥♥♥-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc)Bottom line is that the community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dip♥♥♥♥♥.The rest of the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ only the competitive part can be interesting and fun so if you dont have friends who play CS GO i would recommend you to stay as far away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥community as you possibly can.6/10year olds."

1619,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Extremely toxic community, you will be lucky to not have your whole team scream at you for missing one shot or being cursed for not being fast enough. Other than the cancerous community it's quite a nice game especially if you are playing with your friends and not some brain dead children who will try to find you by your IP address and try to murder you and your relatives for being not as good as them."
1620,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Even though this game is my top played game on steam i can't recommend this to anyone who wants to start playing this game. The gaming community is toxic beyond anyhting. They curse at you, they hate on you, they troll. Anything you could imagine. But the worst part is Valves greedy tactics and the cheaters. The cheaters are basically unstoppable. They are a tumor which you can't get rid of. They are everywhere. In nearly every matchmaking you face at least one cheater. Valve is doing basically bussiness with them by cashing out on their behaviour. Don't buy this game. Also all the weapon skins/ stickers/ glove skins/ sprays etc. are just terrible. This game allows and promotes minors to illegal gamble and make them addicts to it by wasting all the money they have into this game. This is basically criminal. The stress you get is not worth the little fun you will get."

1623,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"This game will give you low trust factor after 1500 hours of queueing with friends and not cheating - so now you'll have to play against cheaters, griefers, and the lowest of the low as a reward for giving your best. The best thing about it is how they don't even tell you why.If you can deal with things sometimes being very unfair for no reason at all: Go ahead and play it. As a game it's still very good and very entertaining. However, the few issues it has (intransparency about trust as well as cheaters - especially ""legit hackers"") are too much for me to recommend it openly though"

1625,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,Pros+ It's counterstrikeCons-A good portion of the CSGO community is cancer in human form. -Nearly every competitive game has at least 2 cheaters on the other team.-You will loose every rank up game to cheaters.-Cheaters Ruin the game-Valve does nothing to stop the rampant cheating in CSGO
1626,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Review: Counter Strike: Global OffensiveGameplay:The Game mechanics are in my opinion pretty simple yet extremely effective.Aiming feels almost flawless, no weapons are overpowered if you have enough experience.Game isnt really trying to be realistic. Its more of a skillset shooter (Spraypatterns, prefire common spots, when to use each weapon, economy and blah blah blah 1 taps)CS:GO has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp. oriented shooter.Multiplayer:Sadly there is the problem. As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun.Community:The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game.There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is.1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages. (malaka, cy ka bly at, kur wa, ich fick deine mutter, youre g ay, blo ody bas tard, kardashian) some examples.Graphics:Game looks ok for a 2004 source engine. Nothing amazing.Performance:Runs on a German Potato like a charm.Price:Its cheap but i personally would pay a premium price for less cheaters.Recommended if you want to die because of cancer."
1627,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Before the latest update, I recommended it. There are three things that I cannot recommend.1,R8revolver's damage2,R8revolver's cost3,R8revolver's number of clipsIn conclusion, plz remove or nerf the R8revolver."

1629,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Let's give this game an honest review.Okay I wanna start by saying that I am a CS series Fan. I have countless hours in CS 1.6, CSCZ (LuL i know) and CSS. And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all.I will explain my negative experience with ""Garbage GO"" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support.Community:The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people:1. Easter European Children,2. Normal People,3. Cheaters.CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game.Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people.Gun Balance:Okay this one is good.Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!!This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS!Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!!  Developer Support: After the AUG being overpowered as ♥♥♥♥ and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me. Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!!All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good.If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game. Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies."
1630,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,Why???? This game was probably the best FPS around in my opinion. I enjoyed it. Screamed at my monitor for dying. I loved it. But this game has completely nose dived into hell. FILLED WITH HACKERS.... and now instead of you know fixing that stuff they decide to jump on a trend and make a BATTLE ROYAL MODE??????!! Literally this game was amazing and then they destroyed it by jumping on something that changed the game completely. Its free now there goes my money. This game was great until they chose to not be original and jump on every trend out there. Thats what killed this game.
1631,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"The Ultimate FPS shooter. If you are an FPS fan this is the game for you. High skill, fast paced rounds, intense gun battles. If you are one of the few people on steam who don't have this game, I highly suggest you add this to your collection."
1632,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013,They added matchmaking to the old formula of gameplay and that has noticeably improved the game. Anticheat is doing its job reasonably well. And well-thought microtransactions implementation sealed the success.
1633,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Now, as you can see from my amount of hours I'm sure you can already tell that I've been a part of the CS:GO community for quite some time now. It annoys me that when I finally have the patiences to sit down and write a review about this game, that it had to be a negative one. I liked this game, loved it at some point, but it has evolved into a monsterious sh*t hole of a game. The updates are just getting rediculous. I have had, give or take, 1600 hours of competitive gameplay done and the ranking system is completely unreliable. I agree with most of the comments that say ""When you reach a certain rank, all you get are hackers."". I've read so many comments on how the community would like for VAC to be better and yet game developers are ignoring this call. Instead, they're making updates of which benefits them ""financially"". Like who in the world said that gloves would be a f*cking great asset to the game and that we needed more things to waste our money on. The game itself is cheap, yes, but the fact that the past updates has been about gaining money is beyond my comprehension. Please fix the game, thank you.Edit: I see now the game has gone Free To Play and implemented Battle Royale. What the hell is Valve thinking? The amount of hackers 10 updates ago were lots but still bareable (around 1 hacker per 15 matches) and now you've gone and opened the doors to them. I am glad I left the game before the previous free-to-play update was released. If any of you guys wanted this game and are happy about the FTP, trust me, you're going to regret getting this."
1634,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"This game gives you:Raging for no reason, it doesn't matter you are a peaceful person or not (comes with a tumorous disease, caused by huge amounts of sodium chloride)Deafness because children under 10 yell at you with their Tesco microphone about your mother who makes sexual intercourse with you or with the kid (the child or kid is a too mild expression for these creatures)Fear, when you hear a language which sounds slavic (by a person whose weapon is an almighty french SMG, and they usually want to get to point Beta fastly)More raging because smurfs, but not the blue ones with white hats (and unfortunately, they rarely go on a VACation)Doubt in your aiming skills (stay calm, this is not your fault, the hitbox and recoil is a joke)Tears of pure sadness, because the hope of HL2, Portal 3, L4D3 and an enjoyable CS lost, because the Valve swims in the money of the clever people who always buys 100 new cases, just to gamble it away (and here is other ""wonders"" like Dota 2 and Artifact)And here is other goodies like AWP, spray drops, rank system, irritating music through mic, high ping, gloves, knives and this is just the tip of the iceberg!Seriously: DO NOT buy this game, DO NOT feed the Valve, buy R6S or PUBG instead, because of the trinity of the CS:GO:The next update always will be a new case (just buy it, and you will be the new king, gamble it away, and buy more and spend more money!)Nobody will help you in the team, honestly what do you expect from a russian, a 9 years old, an AFK and a 800 ping guy? (And the enemy team will contain a smurf, an aimbotter, a global elite, a wallhacker, and the guy who only uses AUG, P90, autosniper or AWP, and will always insult you.)You can aim any rank, but you will never get it, you will stuck in silver forever, frankly you will not receive anything from this game, it will just suck away your time, your money and your neurons...It's a shame Valve doesn't give a fook about kids who became gambling addicts because of the skin sitesEDIT: After 1 year I re-downloaded the game because I wanted to try out the new MP5SD. After some R6S gameplay the shot pattern is just.......ridiculous and unreal, Siege has lucky shots too, but this game has like 3-4 times more. And no, my aim not sucks, I can use all weapons in the game (I've mastered AK one-tapping and AWP flickshot). Guys there is a thousand times better FPS shooters on the market (Insurgency, R6S, Verdun, Squad, Arma, Overwatch etc.), just dont buy this game, you will get mad of it."
1635,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Tried explaining to some 1,000+ player that I had a total of 4 hours clocked in but proceeded to call me a♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. The community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥Tried being sneeky turning corners slowly and all that♥♥♥♥♥♥and was told ""move your ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥ retard"" so as soon I let go of shift I was instantly headshoted by a pistol on the other side of the map, and then was votekicked for being new to csgo. Add something like a boot camp in the ""play"" menu for noobs v noobs"
1636,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"(Update 24th of december)It's just not what it's used to be anymore..Community:COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you."

1638,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Hi my name is Graydon, and I would like to say I havent wasted over 1500 hours of my life on this game.So many things in this game are broken, and id reccomend to stay away from it alltogether to be honest.The ranking system of the game is the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing I have ever seen. The ranking system is based about 99% on game wins. I play with people in this game to have fun. They may not be the greatest, but why should I be punished, and go DOWN in ranking if I get the most kills in the entire game, but overall my team is not able to pull through. The game is filled with hackers, and ""smurfs""(people playing in a ranking lower than their own). Even with ""prime"" people are still able to get around this.

It is impossible to have a single match without atleast a cheater in it. Unless Valve takes action, expect a lot of actual players permanently signing off.

1642,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"The spiritual successor to ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"" (titled cs:go) is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time; wether it's the engaging puzzles or intricate story, this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun. the game's premise is that you're either a ""CT"" or a ""Counter-Troublemaker"" who's job is to stop the ""T's"" or ""Troublemaker's"" shenanigans, such as graffiti, egging houses, or the such. All these are of course now animated, comparative to the simplicity of  ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"". All in all, a great game and tons of fun. But it's kind of a rough port, and i'd reccomend purchase on ps3. 8/10"
1643,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"I will never recommend or possibly play this game again. Too much drama has been poured into this game, that it is sickening. We have devolved to a state of madness which has eternally damned us in the name of CS:GO. First it was the ridiculous overwatch system, which in itself was not a bad idea. However, when looked at on paper, the abuse potential is amazingly high. Then it was Competative mode, the worst thing to ever happen to counterstrike. Then there was the skin gambling scandal. I would rather have cheaters and griefers in CS:GO than have riciculous overwatch bans and griefer bans.  The update on 10/25/2016 they took tooo far. CS:GO had always been a grey topic for me, but now I publically denounced CS:GO and anyone who is a dev, mod, or manager of it. You sold your souls to this? Are you happy players? Is this what you wanted? 'This game' is a disgrace to what counterstrike is supposed to be about. CS:GO devs, you have committed what is unforgivable. Let's just hope this embarrasment of a game is forgotten in 2022. I have never been VAC, Overwatched, or game-banned. I am a normal player who is easily bored, but when tyrants take over games; I cannot remain silent. CS:GO has gone from bad to worse.

But given that this is an online game, the fun gets taken away by other players. You have trolls, cheaters, smurfs (=high-ranked players on new accounts to play against low ranks to feel proud of themselves), and generally other ******** who think smacktalking players who are worse than you is fun.Pair that with the salty teammates you get during competetive games, who get angry at you for not winning certain situations they wouldn't have won either.If you plan to buy this game, be prepared to meet the worst kind of people you can imagine.In other words: the players ruin an otherwise good game."
1650,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"CSGO is a competitive based Team Shooter. Its one of the most popular games on steam,and i dont think I have to explain the gameplay so lets jump straight to the pros and cons.Pros:-Many Gamemodes some for the more Casual Minded and others for the hardcore players-Many tutorials online to get started as a newcomer-Timeless gameplay that is fun escpecially if you play it with some friends-Big amount of Community Server if the standard game modes arent something you want-Runs on a toasterCons-Many People you meet (NOT everybody but most of the time) are pretty toxic-Can get frustrating -Valve Anti Cheat is well...not really working. It can happen from time to time that you get some hackers in Matches.-Smurfs/DeRanker and Griefer will destroy the experience often-Updates that debalance the game -Valve is jut intereseted in selling skins and CasesAs a conclusion if you are a hardcore competitive gamer who doesnt fear a steep learning curve or toxic teammates,and you can ignore the hacker/smurfer/griefer every second game. Then try it out. For everybody else it isnt worth trying. Dont waste your time and money with this game. And try something else! :)Thank you for reading. Have a nice day everybody!"

1653,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Valve recently added a bunch of really cool things like 1 shot kill pistols, nerfed rifles, and built in wall hacks.  Its great to see how good they are at their jobs and how much testing goes into each update."
1654,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"The basic concept of competive Counter-Strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years:  5 terrorists and 5 counter-terrorists fight each other in order to detonate/defuse bomb or eliminate  entire enemy team to win. Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.[HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning.

1655,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"This was once the best game on Steam, until they dropped the ball. They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.The real ranking system:Cheaters on topScammers in the middleLegit players at the bottomAt no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are. It's just a big joke."

1657,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013,"Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at.  A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.  Don't be discouraged by the learning curve.  With great effort, comes great rewards!  Now GO buy it!!"

1659,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"CS:GO is all about horrible and broken shooting mechanics with awful bullet spread, slow♥♥♥♥♥gameplay and a lot of waiting. Also, most of the players are head sick youngsters. It's the worst competitive shooter I've ever played and I can not recommend it for anybody. Save your money, time and nerves.Also, if my opinion hurts your butt - goodbye."
1660,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"The state of this game is an absolute whale of a joke. Valve has shown time and time again for the past 6 years that they could not give one single one about the community matters. Time and time again over this particular game's history, we see them not listen to the community. Honestly, this is the final straw. Nobody asked for Battle Royale, and you can be assured that nobody asked for a free-to-play game. or prime status to all.I paid for this game, and I grinded for the prime status. I cannot play any competitive games with worthy people anymore. I thought getting out of gold was hard before, how about when you can't be sure if that new account really is cheating or not? I paid 15 dollars for this game, but now anybody can get it? Sure, free-to-plays cannot get prime unless they buy the game, but since when has that stopped cheaters? Who is gonna stop the 15 year old with his Christmas money and aimwar⁤e who just aquired a new prime copy of the game? You might aswell give prime to them already because they weren't being stopped.The game plays pretty alright for 64-tick servers, I guess. It's hard to say ""the game is good, community & company are garbage"" because the game isn't even that good. Battle Royale does not fit in this game because CS:GO's combat system isn't really designed for it. It feels like a rushed thing that they just wanted to do to attract more peoples' wallets.In short, the game doesn't really play as well as others, the company does not care at all, and it's just really not that fun."
1661,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"CS:GO is a world famous FPS known for its intense, unique, and deep gameplay and its strong presence in the eSports scene. It's also the game that, at the time of writing this review, I have put the most hours into. It's so addicting, and if you find the right team to play with that communicates and strategizes, is an absolute blast and one of the best FPS games I have ever played.PositivesGreat graphics. The graphics on this game have aged well and look good. They're solid enough to not make you go blind.Built on the Source engine. I've always been a fan of the Source engine. It's very easy to run on any PC, has solid graphics, a deep options menu, which means the game is avaliable to tons of people.Great Gameplay. With smooth movement, unique spray patterns on all the guns, deep strategies gameplay wise and economically wise, ability to move silently, and more, CS:GO's gameplay is awesome. I like it a lot, and I find it very unique. The movement is smooth as well.Everyone is on an even playing field. The skills of a player only rely on their aim, reflexes, and expertise of the game, not XP like in CoD. For example, the other team can't automatically win just because they are all above level 50 and your team is a bunch of level 2s and 3s.Balanced maps. The maps of CS:GO are fine tuned, expertly crafted, and are all unique in their own ways. The defuse maps are constantly updated with tweaks to make them the best that they can be. Some maps receive complete makeovers, such as Train and Nuke, with Dust2 possibly recieving one very soon. The hostage and demolition maps are usually left in the dust as they're underplayed, but they're still solid maps.Operations. These are special events that Valve hold every couple months called Operations. For the price of $7, you can play two player co-op missions with a buddy and get case drops that you can turn around and sell for a dollar or two. Valve also release specially picked community-made maps that everyone can play for free.Community Servers. These servers host custom maps from the workshop. They also host custom gamemodes such as 1v1 and Surf.Skins. I find skins overall neat. While Valve can throw in some ugly and stupid skins, most of the skins are awesome, and are affordable. Some skins range from 3 pennies to thousands of dollars. The only skins I buy are ones that are under a dollar, with my rifle skins being a few dollars. There's likely no way in a million years I'm buying a thousand dollar skin.Gamemodes for both casual and hardcore gamers. While hardcore players will grind competitive defuse for hours a day, there's gamemodes for the casual player too, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, and a casual version of defuse that is easier than competitive defuse.Able to host your own server. While you can buy dedicated servers from various server hosters across the web, you can host your own server off your PC for free by downloading server files directly from Valve, and install custom plugins. I recently started to host my own server for me and a friend where I made it into a 1v1 server. While it's tough to set up, which happens with every server, it's awesome that you can do it for free.MixedToxic community. While there's teammates that are supportive and will communicate and strategize with you, there's also teammates that will insult and harass you if you aren't playing well. They will scream ""He's over there, dumba**! A MAIN!"" in your ear while you're trying to focus on the game. It's insanely annoying, and always gets you killed. Because you died, he'll start a vote to kick you. Screw those toxic POSs. There's teammates that have no idea what they're doing and will run and gun like it's CoD, along with having awful crosshair placement, so they'll be looking at walls when they die. There's teammates that will yell into their mic and act like they're funny. It's a community that's a dense minefield of good and bad, and one bad player can completely ruin your experience.Glove Skins. While I think skins are awesome, I think they're good enough on the guns. Valve have made glove skins, which I rarely see people use. It's just silly to make glove skins while people have been asking for 128 tick servers and a stricter anti-cheat for ages.NegativesVAC isn't the best. While Valve has been fighting cheaters with VAC and the recent creation of the Overwatch system, where specially picked CSGO players can review footage of reported players and judge if they're cheating, hackers are still thriving in CSGO. It's an infamous issue that has plagued the game for ages. While they aren't in every single match you play, they still exist, especially in the higher ranks of competitive.Gambing and Match Betting. Skins have caused negative things to happen that Valve weren't anticipating. People will gamble skins on coin flips and such, which leads into the skin gambling contraversy that exploded not too long ago, and people will bet on matches with skins. It's just sketchy stuff, and has generated some toxicitiy in the CSGO community.64 tick servers. I think 128 tick servers are needed, especially for a game as competitive as CSGO. With all the money Valve has made from CSGO, it's likely that they can update their servers to 128 tick so gameplay is smoother and server-side issues aren't as much of a problem.SummaryDespite all the toxicity associated with the game, CSGO is still a great game in my eyes. It's a unique FPS that I will happily play for many more hours to come so I can hone my skills and become a dominant player.I decided to archive my old review. It's only a picture because of how short it is. You can read it here if you would like to.[i.imgur.com] "

1664,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"This game was good at the beginning. It was really great and I enjoyed it a lot. Right now the game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥and here are two main reasons: Awful community. Most of the time you're playing you're gonna get a dumb kiddo who has no idea about what he needs to be doing. Sometimes you'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players who're just trying to ruin your game. Or sometimes you will get smurfs who're just ""trying to chill"". Valve don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the community. What does Valve do? Of course! They're making sales and selling more copies of this game to smurfs and cheaters. The worst players I've met on MM were: Polish, Russian, French, Turkish and German(No offence to any nationalities, I'm just sayin'). Useless updates. The updates are completely useless. Developers of this game do give a single f*ck about its community. They just want to make money. They do not want to fix the hitboxes, they do not want to fix their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, they do not want to fix bugs. They just want to make money. The game NEEDS fixing. What do they do?

1665,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"I WANT to like this game, i really do. There are just so many things wrong with it that i can't. And i'm not talking about the gameplay itself, I'm talking about the people. The amount of hackers, greifers, major a**holes and toxic people is rediculous. Hacking is pointless and stupid and makes the game not fun for others. Just play the actual game. Besides hackers, there are people in competitive games who make you want to rage quit or shoot them by blocking your way to not let you out of spawn on PURPOSE, therefore getting a 30 minute-7 day ban. And then there are the ones who kick people for being a different race or being a weeb for no other reason. It's horrible. I can't belive there are people who would do such a thing like that. I can't believe this is what we've become. There are other things that i have problems with, like competitve skill groups, and the fact that i have met people who i became friends with, but were actually just pretending the entire time, or all of a suddon hate me for who i am. But i think i've said enough. I would give this game 0/10, but because of all the good times i had with people, all the experiences i had in the 300 hours i played this game, i'm giving it 5/10. Would still not recommend playing, but it's your decision.Edit: yes, it is extremely addicting, for me anyway."

1667,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"As a hardcore Valve fan, Long time steam user, and with 1000+ hours on record.I can't reccomend this game.Valve needs to communicate more with its playerbase, and the more people the support their actions directly against the community, support their poor communication. I love Valve. I've been here for 15 years on steam, and pre-date steam with the first Counter-Strike. And with that being said, Valve needs to stop ignoring the community and start talking to us. This update? Free-to-play? Battle Royal?! It's far from anything anyone from /r/csgo or /r/valve ever would have asked for. We constantly ask for updates other Valve titles like TF2 and we get silence. This game was the best FPS i've ever played, and now it's something completely different. The competitive nature of it originally turned into something much more toxic and tainted. Loot crates were added, making the game feel based on weath, and the more and more people got crates the more they felt superior to others. People turned on other people making it such a toxic environment, and the competitivity grew and grew. Hackers were always a problem, and Valve was only minute on the subject. And if you want to know the brutally honest truth, it's that I still love this game. But with a sane mind, I can't reccomend it."
1668,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Note: This is a temporary review, I'm still pretty new to the game so I'll write another one when I invest/waste more hours on it-My First GameI remember it really well, because it was a game that summed up CSGO almost perfectly. Dust 2, a micspammer named ""Martin Shkreli"" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from ""Rush B"". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that.-GamemodesCasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your ""skills"" and map knowledge here pretty easily.Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is.I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever.If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool):MeAmerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensAngry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseAnother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuesSomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vieOther team:Uber SmurfSomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiesSomeone in a partySomeone else in the same party who says ""ez"" every time they win a roundAnime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and ScoutUh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool. -Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style.Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Tec 9 Rush B♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Idi Nahui-Round Two: Some SMG -Round Three: AKs-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and ArmorCounter Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy-Round Two: Some SMG-Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and ArmorEco Round? Doesn't exist in low Silver xDSave? Doesn't really happenStrategy? ""B"", ""Rush B ♥♥♥♥♥"", ""Long A"", ""Short A"", ""A split"" and that's about it.You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or ""accidentally"" teamkill.-Rank up SystemCS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it.-SmurfingA ""smurf"" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc. If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game.-VAC System/OverwatchYeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision.-CommunityI've heard many times that the CS:GO community is ""toxic"" and ""cancer"" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the ""toxic"" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?).-Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ""Sweaty Nerds"" who play basically nonstopUnmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- ""Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!""Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/Cuties and Hotties (right here)Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...)Australian Bogans (basically Russians here)Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the gamePeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of themGrill GamersPeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them-YouTube presence/MLG CS:GOThere are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense. I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them.PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit.-CS:GO Skins and CasesI've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove.-Valve/Game DevelopersEh, I've seen many reviews saying that ""CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!"" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game.-Friendly Aspect to the game?Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower.-Overall OpinionIt's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not ""die"" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come. Dayum, that was a LONG review, its just that CS:GO has so much in it to cover. It's pretty good."

1671,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"This game has honestly turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥with the latest update. Every single game mode including competitive has turned into the wild west with everyone using the one shot $850 pistol. I've played the game pretty much every single day for the past 5 or so months that I've owned csgo, but in the games current state I won't be playing much anymore. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone in it's current state. Do NOT buy this game until valve has fixed everything, if they ever do....."
1672,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off.Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you.It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way."
1673,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"This is an extremely mixed and short review.I think the game has cool and original gameplay. Though it doesn't highly innovate, it stills maintains the Counter-Strike gameplay that has been going on for about 15 years. Let's talk about the community. About 5% of the people you meet on Global Offensive are really nice people. 95% think they're MLG♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and WILL kick you if you're not very good. I've been kicked multiple times and it feels awful, to think that people don't want you on your team. Makes my stomach drop to the bottomless pit.Seriously, beware of the abysmal community and stick with your friends. If you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning, you'll have a much better time than you would being John Rambo.But now I'm going to say this is an amazing game and I totally recommend playing it if you like competetive, slow-paced games then play with a group of friends, you'll have fun. "
1674,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"The ever so popular Counter Strike: Global OffensiveWhat do i think of this game? Well, to begin with Counter Strike is a very unique FPS game.  i first played this game in spring 2013 on and off. i finally think i have enough experience to write a review. Unlike other fake games we shall not name (CoD, BF) this game requires some knowledge and skill to play. Pros:Counter Strike does not require a super beefy computer and can be played with a average set up and hardwareCounter Strike has a ""decent"" community and most players are friendly to the other players (i said ""decent"")Counter Strike is not a pay to win game, you are not required to pay money and keep playing, the Operation passes are to support the devs and help keep the game going.Counter Strike has a growing community and you should be able to find competitve matches quickly (depending on the maps you select)Counter Strike has Dust II, Dust II is the best map every created for Competitive level of gameplay.Counter Strike is not FTP, if Counter Strike was FTP the community would crumbleCons:Counter Strike has had problems with Smurfs in the past, the problem has been fixed a little bit, but there are still some smurf problems. Smurfs can ruin a entire game and i know some players who quit playing because of the SmurfsCounter Strike has some hacker and cheater problems, i have played many games where i have run into a cheater. Cheaters ruin the game and it is no fun to play with cheaters.(There are some players who will play without a mic, grief, or throw games, this mostly occurs at lower levels, however i have not run into many of these players)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------These are my thoughts on the game Counter Strike: Global OffensiveI would really suggest giving this game a try if you have not tried it before Thank you for taking your time and reading my review- Boingdom"

1676,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"THE competitive FPS game. Great fun to play, although the community can be a right pain in the rear, and it suffers from its fair share of hackers. Practise will make you better, and there is a massive number of steam workshop maps and other items available for it.Oh, and skins :P"
1677,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"The new revolver is stupid. CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such. Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money. To conclude I believe Valve should remove the R8 from CS and forget it ever existed due to the reasons above. :trainbowbarf::trainbowbarf:Sorry about the rant but this update has been rather disappointing xD"
1678,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,Can't open the game after update. I have tried everything even reinstalling it nothing happened. I tried my friends desktop he has amd graphics card it keeps crashing again and again.
1679,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,I don't have idea why this game is so popular?! This is impossible how this game has got 9 milion players. Maybe it's because of low priority of how good is ure computer. Or maybe skins... idk but i can tell that this game is very passable :/

1684,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"So I bought this game way back when, now it is free to play. No problem there. But making me pay for the prime status seems like a slap in the face of everyone that has bought this game before it. Money grabbing if you ask me."
1685,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,This game is one of the best competitive games out their but its over the most over rate game of all time. People say its better than COD but that can only be a statement for people who play both games competitivly. If your looking for fun casual/comp game then COD is their but if your looking for a very very competitvly game with minor fun this game is for you. Also the amount of support this game gets is♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to how much money they take out of people who open cases. They never make a new map only remake ones to make it better which will take more than 10 months to ♥♥♥♥ing make and then once the new map is released it will still be unplayable. Im giving this game a negitive review as i believe its the most over rated game ever developed and comparing it to other fps's is stupid as they different.

1687,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"I'll go in depth as to why my reasoning is what it is: The ""matchmaking"" is non-existant, I've played a fair few games of competitive, yet rarely do they seem balanced or fair, as a player with little under 100 hours, I get pitched against players with 300/400 hours, how can Valve call this sorry excuse of a matchmaking system good? I find it appauling that they could even consider saying this game even contains matchmaking. Another large problem is hackers, they seem to slip past Valve with little to no problems, either Valve don't care, or have given up trying to prevent them. Overall, a 5/10, as the game itself isn't the problem, it's Valve's end that's letting it down largely."
1688,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015," The good One of the most famous multiplayer game Various types of game (Arms Race, Deathmatch, Demolition, Casual, Competitive) Nice graphics and sound Items drops while playing that you can sell in steam market The bad Sometimes the teammates don't help each other and end up losing matches because of that To play competitives you have to get about 1 hour to play without leave the game You can easly get addicted to the game!

1690,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018," Valve Anti CheatOkay Valve. I spent $20 dollars on this game only for it to go free just a year later? I want my money back.I was really annoyed at the time this review was written, so pardon my redundant vocabulary throughout this review.Valve taking advantage of their customersComparable to other greedy f**knuggets in the gaming industry, today, Valve has set the bar up there with EA and Bethesda.You know what Valve, instead of using all that money and resources you got sitting over there to give us, your customers, our long awaited sequels we've respectfully requested since 2004. Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit.Valve's GreedYour intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month? Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this?The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k. You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t.EpilogueI can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from.This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated.Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons.Here's a clip to summarize my experience in Counter-Strike: Global OffensiveBut tell me what you think. Am I overreacting? Or is what I say pretty spot on?Tell me your thoughts and opinions in the comments below."

1701,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Look,csgo was a good game,a decent game before the ""danger zone"" update.It had less hackers and etc.It was better in everyway.But now its free.This is a big mistake.You are just giving hackers a chance to create a new account and continue hacking when they get vac banned.Valve you should fix this.And what about the people that gave money to buy this game?Im one of them.Making the game free is pointless,You guys should have just lowered the prices."
1702,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"And so, I had played this game for like 3-4 years, had 2k + hours on it, and with my experience in this game, All I gotta say about is : 1) Stupidly ""special"" gameplay needed, that differs from other games! Even if they claim to have ""fixed"" the whole HitBox system, is still s**t! I still was shooting people, seeing blood coming out, even heard the Headshot sound, but no reg. Funny thing right? Happens... (it should not)2) One of the Worst anti-Cheat system (VAC) that even a 14 years old kid, with a really small knowledge of programming can get through that by-pass. Funny thing when they released this whole ""Overwatch"" thing, when you are LEM with 2k+ hours, and there's a Gold Nova 2 with 350+ hours to judge your gameplay if you're hacking or not!3) Really bad gaming community including 12 y.o. kids from Different countries , having 0 knowledge of English. Same happened with older players. Toxic players are no. 2 problem, but I gotta admit, people are Not as toxic as the League of Legends' ones... 4) Really bad servers, with the whole valve giving 0 f***s about it. (64 ticks while Every damn other Community server has 128)5) Absolutely bad Game Support (you can't even e-mail them, you have to search deep to find an address to contact them)6) SMURFS. I had played some Smurfs games on it, pretty easy and stuff, but NO worth... as I had my♥♥♥♥♥kicked from Supremes and Globals, and I was pretty mad about it, I stopped doing that! Many people just wanna show off their skill to Low rank people, are something more than Pathetic! unless you're a Youtuber and you wanna make some Funtages out of it, there's No reason to do it! And yeah, if you're a new player expect a LOT , but a LOOOOT of these f**kers around. 7) Game un-balance. Cheaper guns are way better than Expensive ones! 2.700$ 1-shot kill and 3.100$ 2-shot kill in the Head! Not to mention 500$ Tec-9 at close range! As much as the Prices are so close to Realism, gameplay is NOT! I can say that I used to have fun games 2 years ago, made a lot of friends from this game, bad as the time goes by, this game is dying and Valve is responsible for this! If a whole game company doesn't care for a game they made, that is the Most populated they ever made, then there's no reason to keep playing it!  If you're a new player , or even if you're thinking of getting this game, DON'T DO IT! Get some more money, and spend them on other games, or even Free2Play games that are actually WAY better than this... Or even just buy yourself a good MacDonalds meal. It gives you Less cancer than this game."

If we all do only one overwatch per day, we probably will reduce big % of cheaters in CS:GO.Also if you can and have option to make prime account....JUST DO IT ! (better for you and your nerves)Good luck to all and have a nice days :)"
1707,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Well, CS was dying already...Valve decided to go in to the Battle Royale trail and make the game free2paly insted of getting a decent anti cheat... so! there is a sh't ton more players now and sh't ton more hackers too that = to every single COMPETITIVE GAME I did since the upadate there is AT LEAST 4 people hacking...What I'm saying is that this game was worth buying BUT now its not even worth to install... unless you going to hack too, so I don't even know why you reading this insted of ruining the fun for others right now"
1708,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"The game is a money pit filled with hackers. The rank system is a joke.Overwatch is a joke.VAC is a joke.There is no anti-cheat system for this game.It has a tired engine. (2004) Source engineIt's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone  other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people  hence people having so many accounts...I have 1 account and proud of it.I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"".If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!Once again another update this time destroying the most played map in CS. Nuke was bad enough. Old Nuke was great. New Nuke sux. Old Dust 2 great. New Dust 2 sux.You want to fix something fix the anti-cheat I mean put an anti-cheat so the game can be enjoyed.For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !This game would be great........ There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.The Facts and nothing but the facts........!                                             Oh did i mention the game is a joke !Changing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's name to ""Hackfest Simulator"""
1709,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"First of all I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood but not everything is fine and dandy and I will address some of these issues in my review. First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on....Recently, someone left this comment on my review, his/her name was Choinka:Screenshot of the comment: http://imgur.com/a/i80j3Comment: 'Cant unsee the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.'My Response: 1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it.3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver....5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers).  6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game. Regards,Arctik."
1710,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"First of all, I have a large body of hours on this game. I've seen multiple game breaking updates, e.g. initial implementation of the CZ-75, Revolver, (at the time) massive change to game sounds, slowing down awp scope speed, super fast crouching scout running and many more. However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever.But to be fair there has been multiple positive updates: Getting rid of the fire car on dust 2 long. That's all I can think about at this moment. But I'm sure there's more.However, I have to play this game:1. because I have skins that are worth more than my petty existance, 2. There's something addicting about being british and joining a game and speaking with an accent,3. On the occasional games that teams are balanced and there's no cheaters, they have been known to be fun (I swear),4. Every other shooter is just boring cos of the huge player base on counter-strike,5. I have invested so many hours in this game, I just don't know what to do anymore."
1711,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Its been 3 years sinc Im playing this game and following pro scene very closly. I guess, its time for a very short review.Heads up to the community for making Counter Strike as one of the biggest e-sports titles again.But if anything else - this game is pretty big pile of crap. IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure. Nonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is."

1715,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell."
1716,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other."
1717,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Well hi and thanks for stopping by.After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO.If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull.What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say10/10Looking forward to playing more."
1718,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"I don't really know why Global Offensive costs less than Source, but nevertheless, this is a great game, the successor of a real legend. It's a little hard to adapt if you come from games like Battlefield or CoD because of the recoil and no sights, but if you are dedicated, you can master it in no time. If you are a fan of shooters, you MUST play this game... but warning: it'll be addicting as hell."
1719,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Things I gave to Counter-Strike: 1. Money2. Money3. Money4. Time 5. Love Things Counter-Strike gave me: 1. Arthritis 2. Rage 3. Racism4. Broken keyboard 5.

1720,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Valve just released a new update giving each traded item a tradeban of 7 days, which absolutely killed trading for now. Since trading skins is a big part of csgo and makes it fun to play (at least for most people including me) the tradeban is quite a disaster. Best way to discribe valve managment is this picture: https://imgur.com/a/emAfA#I7OHYeK (source: Roo_ooky on Reddit).Make trading great again!"
1721,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"It was a good game. But we paid for it and now it is free? At least give us a refund. But in all seriousness, when the game is free, VAC ban means nothing. It is VERY easy to hack CSGO, and now that VAC doesn't mean anything, there are LOTS of hackers. This was once a great game, but now it is a waste of time. There are better games out there. Games without hackers. Don't waste your time on this."
1722,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters. It's a real shame that the console version isn't closer to the PC version though, they could have given COD a run for their $."
1723,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,The games decent.Those are the good things. Now here are 10 reasons not to play this 'Great Family Friendly Game'1. TOXIC COMMUNITY.2. Very unbalanced. (a pistol can kill someone with a ak-47...3. Way to many cheaters4. Way to many Griefers/Derankers5. You're going to get dumb  kids who buy $150 knifes with there mums credit card who will call you poor... (from experience)6. No one in the lower ranks takes the game seriously which can be a big pain for new players wanting to actually play the game properly7. Only like 10-20 people work on the game. Which is why you get useless/boring updates (operation hydra)8. Valve only care about the money 9. Valve don't listen to the community who could make the game so much better but instead they put alot more money into dota 2...10. And finally but almost obvious... Valve's VAC system on csgo is just as terrible as the community.
1724,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"The game is not fun, it is not rewarding to play, you will not enjoy yourself, you will not make any significant progress in the complete abortion of a competetive ladder, and you will hate yourself because of it. You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place. You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and adore them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it. If you want a surefire way to make sure your game rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and simultaneously make sure that nobody playing your game gives a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game itself, there's no simpler system than a virtual goddamned casino. But, you know, they made the game so, like, good for Valve! Let's have a round of applause for Valve, the company that singlehandedly turned an entire generation into gambling addicts! This game is a broken pile of neglected♥♥♥♥♥♥with no redeeming qualities, barring an unintended engine exploit dating back to 1996, that the current devs have tried their best to kill anyways.Do not buy this game if you value your time, your mental health, your money, or your morality."
1725,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"HI!I was playing Counter Strike, while 2 kids were flooding/ spamming the mic, in a language I did not understand, which obviously wasn't English. In this specific game, I was leading, and the team was winning. So I asked them to be quiet, and suddenly all the team decided to kick me. It happened to  be that the whole team knew their language. So tell me please, why do I have to suffer from 12 year old kids/ get kicked when it's not my fault, and ruin my rank??? That's why I spent 15$ on a game and I can't even enjoy it??? It seems to me that you are running from your responsibilities, kids kicking good players, Counter Strike's poor ""vac"" performances, every freaking game contains at least one cheater and tons of rasist comments. And by the way, I was kicked twice because I muted my ""fellow"" teammates, cause they were spamming the mic, and I was kicked cause I didn't listen for their directions. It's unfeair, and due to all the hours, the money and the efforts I spent, I can't even enjoy my favorite game."
1726,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"My brother is an ""avid amateur chess player"". That's how he describes himself when making small talk.You should see his room. It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him)So anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw a new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly.But what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head. The whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle.So approached the artifact, and I bit the tip off. Unfortunately for me, my brother saw me do it.Unfortunately for him, I move as quick as a fox.I was a dancing blur of after image, avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me. I slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad's room. I locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down.Then I asked myself, ""Self, what do I do now?"".So I booted my dad's PC, which I also use for gaming, logged into Steam and saw that CS:GO was on sale.I bought it. It is an ok game."

1729,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Don't bother buying this game the Dev and Admins are idiots who don't know how to properly run a game. Instead they turned this game into a simple cash grab scheme. Playing casual matches or competitive all favors cheaters, how so? Can't end a game early in competitive without someone abandoning the match, in which that player then recieves a cooldown ban. For casual matches there are so many idiots who cannot spot cheaters and just question the person accusing that they suck, bunch of kids these days with their mommy's credit card..F*** you valve"
1730,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013,"I purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours. It was absolute crap and I un-installed it.Fast forward almost one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version.The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99.If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way."

1732,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"There's plenty of things to like about today's modern shooters, but Counter-Strike is the only one of its kind designed to be anything other than a throwaway novelty you replace every year."
1733,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"This is a really good game to own in my own opinion because you can make friends, kill other teams by any way you can think about, and you can become a future star just by working hard and entering tournaments and winning. Just look at Pro's like Fallen, Taz, ECT. Back to the game though, it isn't perfect. Hackers, trades gone wrong, and insulting teammates isn't the best, but those are worst case scenario's. The plus side is so much better than the negetives. Custom games you can make, friends you can type to, and the epic headshots I know you will make will blow you out of your chair. All in all, if you are looking for a shoot-em up game that includes a little strategy and a lot of fun, then you should get this game. I give it a 9/10. So what are you waiting for? Go get a headshot for me and make a name for yourself that no one will forget!"
1734,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"If you enjoy:-Being verbally abused by Eastern European children younger than the game itself-Smurf accounts everywhere-Hackers and script kiddies everywhere-Loot boxes and glorified gambling on a premium game-Horrible community-Paying upwards of 100+ dollars for some pixels somebody worked 2 hours to make-The♥♥♥♥♥♥poor VAC system that does nothing to get rid of hackers-And useless updatesThen by all means buy the game, if you are not a masochistic psychopath stay far far away from it, the gameplay is good, don't get me wrong. It has a nice mix of strategy and skill to deliver a pretty good gameplay experience. But by god the community is more toxic than nuclear reactor made out of concentrated cyanide having a meltdown.This game is not fun unless you are an Eastern European kid who stole his mom's credit card to buy $500 dollar knives"
1735,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"I personally enjoy the game, and continue to play it frequently. But the point of this review system is to let people who haven't bought it know about what they're getting in to. That's why I don't recommend it. If you jump into casual to learn the ropes and play with other people there's a 90% you'll get kicked because you don't know how to play, didn't defuse the bomb because you don't know where it is, or maybe you'll get kicked just because someone called a vote for no reason and everyone hit F1 because it's a funny me me to kick people for no reason. You'll get abused over mic and text chat constantly until you ""git gud"", and then even when you do it will still continue.If you play competitve to try and get better and progress through the skill ranks there's a 90% chance you will get yelled at continuously if you are last alive, pointing out everything you do wrong in their eyes, even though they are already dead.This games community is absolutely terrible and while there are nice people that just want to have fun or help out new people, they are a dime a dozen.If you think you'll be fine with all this go right ahead and buy it, it's an incredibly satisfying feeling when you can play, and even moreso when you do those pro™ strats™. But for new players this is an awful game that continues to insult you until you don't want to play anymore, it's happened to more than a few of my friends that tried to get in to it.Overall, great game if you persist, terrible game if you want to jump in to it casually"
1736,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Sorry guys. Don't hate me for this.CS:GO was a good game. Until the cancer hit. The goddamned Battle Royale cancer. I am so fed up with this hype. Valve's money greedy actions lately have worsened more and more (see Artifact's Pay2Pay model). I am seeing myself forced to boycot everything Valve's thinking about making easy and fast money with. So screw you Valve moneypigs, one less p(l)ayer for you. P.S.: Oh, and go right ahead and increase the Steam Market shares on your side aswell. I won't give a little fart since I won't be using it anymore."
1737,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Great game that can teach you many things such as:1. The Russian language.2. How to be a tough guy that is afraid of nothing behind a screen.3. How to be racist and sexist.4. How to be spoiled as ♥♥♥♥.5. How awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch.6. How to be disappointed in human beings.7. How to socialise in a civilised and calm manner (/s).And last but not least, how to be a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason at all.Aside from that, if you're willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game. It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilize (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour."
1738,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"There's a lot of hot-tempered mad people in this game, who can easily get very angry and start swearing at each other, they use violence and very offensive words that might shock you, most of the players as i've seen are very hostile between one another using foul languages as they speak and have such bad behaviour, they swear at your mum and dad and your entire family. They're so rude. Barbaric savage behaviour can be ignored most of the time but sometimes it gets to you, it gets to your heart and brings tears to your eyes.Hackers as always."
1739,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2012,"I love to play Office Counter: Strike Source.  This game is great you have to stop the troops, and win the war.  My favorite rifle to buy is the pistol because it's free you should try out the pistol gun when you play."
1740,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"I imagine an awful lot of the fans of this game have not played other FPS games. Having been playing such games since the inception of DOOM, I can honestly say I just cannot get a feel for any FPS now adays that do not have scoping on weapons (other than sniper rifle). I think Payday ruined other FPS games for me."
1741,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"After December 2015 update , this game became unplayable , it's now Call of Juarez with♥♥♥♥♥♥RNG and tons of less skill. The sad thing is this game was all about skill and 0 about RNG just 3 days before this review."
1742,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"there is no game out there that I got as much into as I got with cs:go. All started with me watching competative matches on warowl's channel. and I saw these elite players with their godlike skills and fancy new skins (the arms deal update came around). and I was like damn, I want to play like them. so I bought the game. I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole. I'm going to break 1000 hours this week, I have a 300 euro inventory, a clan that get's better and better by day, a youtube channel and the best thing: endless fun. You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge. CS:GO is a game that will 100 % occupy you if you're eager and competative or even if you just love community based games with a sht ton of human interactions through VoIP"
1743,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015," Counter-Strike: Global Offensive After 1k of hours spended on that game I can finally say that is a good time to make a reviev. It is a very fun game but destroyed by the community. Most people do not treat this game as fun this game becomes a battlefield of insults and lack of courtesy. In this game if you failed it at something and you die there is no forgive you will be called a noob or even worse, and probably you will be kicked from the game. And talking about the Russians that they scream in their own language is bad but I meet a lot of people from that country that was nice for me. Let's not forget the on our way we meet two of the worst groups of players: Those who do not know how to lose, and the mass of childrens who most likely they squeaky voice gonna to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, and almost I forgot about cheaters. I highly recommend to everybody that masterpiece. During the game you will know a lot of very friendly people that will probably hate you for no reason. Maybe it's because their brains totally burned out by this game or skins, I don't know but hey have fun and like my reviev or no whatever, just leave me alone. "
1744,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"BE CAREFUL! VALVE supports cheaters to beat you up in the game.They ban them, and offer them a cheap way to come right back into the game.They do Banwaves, following a SALE on the game, so everybody who got banned can buy a new copy of the game and continuing CHEATING.If you like to get beaten, buy VALVE games, if not, then dont."

1747,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Heads up, I will still be playing this game since the game itself is very good and addicting, just read the thumbs down.Counter-Strike has made it's way to one or maybe the best first person competitive shooter, every gun has to be mastered atleast decently to win the gun fights between you and the enemy. A very fun and challenging shooter with it's own unique mechanics and matchmaking system.Anyone that's interested in tactical shooters will most likely buy the game, expecting a whole new experience between strategy and skill.This is where most players quit.The expectation of the looks and mechanics are the same as they have seen in either a video or stream. A youtuber who enjoys a match of solo queue.What they get:- Higher skilled players with new accounts ruining low ranks- Cheaters- A Toxic community- TrollsEvery game I have played was there was 70% smurfs and the rest trolls and cheaters. Doing all the wrong and screwing over the matchmaking system where it becomes unfair for newer people that still have to learn, as for the toxic community flaming and blaming the new ones for trying to learn the game. (votekicking)Ofcourse there are alternatives matchmaking clients but new people do a little bit know that their skill won't fit for that.I recommend you to queue with 4 friends and that you play regularly with them, that is the best way to learn and not be screwed over by a team griefer.So do I recommend the game itself?Yes, I love how you have to use both of your brain and skill to win the game.Do I recommend the game to new people reading this?If you want to buy it, then buy it, thats up to you since it's your money.The reason I won't recommend it is that it will be very hard to learn and enjoy the game. Ofcourse not everyone is a scumbag, it's just that the game won't be fun as you tought it was by these people and I don't want you to waste your time and money."
1748,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"I loved the game until the winter update, It has made this game more rng based after the rifle patch.  I dont even have to explain what the r8 has done to the game.  I was a good supporter of csgo for a long time until the 2015 winter update.  I will not be playing this game until what they have done is reversed."
1749,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"I put a lot of time into this game and I got pretty decent at it, but it got to a point where victories were no longer satisfying and losses were usually the results of really salty teammates or smurfing/scripting enemies. I have over 300 hours and I paid $15 for the game, so I no doubt got my money's worth, but half of it wasn't even enjoyable. It really comes down to what kind of matches you get put in, but I think you'll find yourself getting annoyed with the game more than enjoying it past a certain point."

1753,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here.Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere.

Couldn't type anymore.So I deleted the French version as far as English is the most used langage in the world :)Be aware that I am only 18 and I self-taught English to myself, so it might be bad. FPS Amateur, welcome to CS:GO!One of the best and most popular current FPS in the World! (Please, don't get me wrong and don't say that I said it's the < Best Game ever > :P)As far as I know, I am not a big fan of FPS games, which show how much this one is a good one :DBut don't get me wrong. I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)The good stuffs about CS:GO:- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)Which can be nice to have too! :D- The game is based on real skills.Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!- Many maps available.The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!- New cases shows up regularly in game.Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).What's the good point about that?If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.And one week later, the price would be around $1.So, try your luck on the first days!- Last part of the good points:Rankeds are really nicely optimized.One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.The bans system work that way:1rst ban: 30 minutes.2nd ban: 2 hours.3rd ban: 1 day.4th ban: 7 days.Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!)  Negative facts: - I'm gonna make it simple..Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^But, don't give up!Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.- Les hackers.Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.- Hackers.Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.- Some players ruining the community.Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.But they are not only them.Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..It comes from everywhere!There is no perfect community.They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAoThanks god, there is a ""Mute"" button! :)Anyway! I am gonna stop here. There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :) "

1763,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Very addicting game.  The strongest point this game has is its history.  The game has been around for over a decade.  It has a very steep learning curve, and a high skill ceiling to match.  The most vibrant competitive scene of any FPS on the market.  You can see my full review of the game here.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xQXscUV_wQ "
1764,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,This is one of the worse games i have ever â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing played.  They are to busy releasing god awful skins instead of testing there updates. I hope Valve burns in hell for what they have done to what was once a decent game.

1766,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"The feeling is different from the other Counter-Strikes, but the formula is still the same. With a variety of pre-defined T/ CT factions and skins on the Market, you don't always have to download them since they're yours to keep.And skins 4 life."
1767,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,I think it is a bad update. Many people want trade their items more than once a week. This is an incorrect way to combat fraud because it creates problems for players and users of Steam. This update will have a bad impact on the market & on the reputation of the game. Online indicators will fall with sell graph. Nobody expected this update. It is very uncomfortably. All of us is asking to return old trade rules or at least short ban to 1 day.We hope you will hear us. It is very impotant for us.Thank you.#FREETRADE#STOPTRADEBAN
1768,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"一群人 一个青春 一个游戏 一辈子 CSGO Forever.I am definitely a CS:GO lover！ I started playing CS:GO from June 1st 2014. I was only able to play on iMac the past one and half year. February 2016, I finally built up my first gaming PC. On March 2st 2016, I got invited to IEM ESL KATOWICE 2016 (Also called ICK 2016, the CS:GO female tournament) with Team Elysium Female. BEST TRIP IN MY LIFE. 14年第一次看的比赛是科隆，15年初我在斗鱼转播高清的卡托比赛。那时候主播很少，妹子也没有。虽然看不太懂，但是就是觉得很好看。半夜四点起来就转播比赛，然后用着小银条的技术""解说“比赛。观看的人很多，弹幕也被刷的满满的，想想就超级激动。还记得是Fnatic拿了冠军，那天yicofan也在qq里和直播间里一直跟我看。已经不再怎么玩游戏的我，一辈子都没有想到整整一年后，居然是和妹子还有yicofan站在卡托的决赛舞台前观看比赛。。。那个画面，真的一辈子都忘不了。。。也谢谢你们给我的这个机会因为CSGO相识后面基的好友：榛子Hazel，曾哥Yicofan，大眼睛，维维Timing，乔阿姨大哥SAGA，大橙子，小鱼儿tingtian :2017stickypopsicle:坐等面基喜+1"

1770,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow.Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.Otherwise can't recommend."
1771,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"I've dumped probably closer to 2k hours in this game spread across numerous accounts.Game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, smurfs and cheaters kinda tilt games pretty hard.Don't get me wrong CS is a good game, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the community is like terminal cancer on a unicycle.Literally had a kid keylog me over the course of three months to steal CS items I had a year or so ago like Jesus Christ how desperate must you be.Community is really♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can never talk over mic without being harrassed or♥♥♥♥♥♥on.If you wanna lose your will to live and you've got thick skin feel free to play CS.If not I'd suggest finding a different hobby.7/10 would play again"
1772,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"This is the 3d CS game and i still see the cheaters. And valve cant fix it. They sell you skins, keys, but they cant make good game for you.They dont care about your game play. And actualy why they shoud? Better ban ppl and sell them game again. And nobody cares about do you cheat or know. And remember every time you help overwatch you make their job for them with no pay.Shame on you valve."
1773,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Biggest $hit in the world history, dont recommend playing that piece of junk. Ruskies vladimir p90 everywhereedit: 2 years later, my psyche is totaly ruined by this cancer, wouldnt be surprised if i had one already, please gaben kys, even in games like this there is handicap, kys pls you will do a favor to all humanity"
1774,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Boy oh boy is this ****** cancer!Very unfriendly to new players. Low ranks are a bottomless pit with no escape unless you get a whole new account due to smurfs, trolls, hackers and people who are idiots. Loss after loss forever, versus 5 cued smurfs on the other team or hackers.So you would think, after spending CASH on this game, that I would be able to play with my friends, right? I bought the game for that.Nope! You have to play 5 hours of casual. During which, people micspam racist music and other things, act toxic, insult, etc.After that- Things will get better, right? Nope! Low rank matches have hackers upon hackers, smurfs upon smurfs, and you get loss after loss as you're trying to learn the game. Why would Valve increase the price of their game or IP ban hackers? The hackers buy the game for $15 again and again, to troll 2 to 4 matches, then get banned, and repeat. And repeat. So why would they stop if it makes them money?I would much prefer to spend $60 on a game I know works than $15 on a game that is nothing but aids and racial slurs.Once you win 10 comp. matches, things get better, right?Nopity Nope! You get banned for a full 24 hours FOR WINNING. You have to sit there AND WAIT and can't play comp again!Add a new paypal account? Great- you can't trade items for 6 days!Just got the game? Great! You can't sell or buy items for a full month!Everything about this game treats new players like they're cheaters/hackers/smurfs/trolls, while allowing experienced players to do those things with little effort. Very steep learning curve that is not helped in most ways, very toxic community, very fustrating game mechanics, server performance getting worse every day- rubber banding at 65 ping, if you have more than 250ms ping you teleport all over the map and can do nothing at all, and on top of it all- you get banned just for WINNING. As well as abandoning.Would not recommend stay away, you have been warned."
1775,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2012,"Probably my favorite in the series thus far. The weapons are far more balanced, there are more reasons to use grenades other then flashbangs and the gameplay on the whole feels more refined.It's still Counter Strike to it's core, but it shows Valve isn't afraid to risk♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off their fanbase to release a new one."
1776,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"You thought the revolver update was bad? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, you're wrong. This update that Valve decided to release out of nowhere has to be a hard smack in the face for anyone who actually just finished buying the game. Also not only that but they decided to make it even easier for people to just hack in their game.. Just ♥♥♥♥ing sad. Honestly stay away from this if you're planning on starting as a new player."
1777,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Product received for freeNot much content , just a simple fps game withs skins and stickers that u can sell on market.  Don't try too hard on competitive because u more likely derank than ranking up. Edit: Apparently this negative review is causing people to get ""triggered"" just because i was sharing my opinion, apparently that isn't allowed and i can't say bad things about a game. Shows that the community is Toxic, too."
1778,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Perform poorly in one game and get trashed talked. Perform highly in the next game and nobody says anything.Most stressful game ever, but hell, it's worth it. The feeling of power when you are carrying your team to victory is like no other! Not to mention the fact you can get skins for your weapons! Beyond reasonible doubt you do not need to spend anything on this game apart from the money spent buying it in the first place. For those not interest in competetive play, CSGO has many community servers available such as Surf and JailBreak.All in all its a fun game to mess around with mates or prove your worth in commetitive."
1779,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,Would definately recommend this game above all other fps on the market. Arma/Insurgency has that real feel - COD has that arcade feel and CSGO slots perfectly inbetween. Best played with a group of Mates :)

We've seen it over and over again, the ONLY way to get Valve's attention is to write negitive reviews, start a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc... because they WILL not respond to anythign else other than negitive press."

1782,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Was a good game until the most recent update. Decided to finally hop on the fortnite bandwagon i see. Making it free to play could have possibly been their worst decision ever. Way to make your community feel left out. And to try and compensate they gave your a Veterans member badge which means jackâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ a ""Special crate"" which you recieved for being a valued customer, only thing is you still gotta pay for it to open it, and to top it off a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥graffiti spray. Such a low blow to your fans. Hopefully all of your new 6 year old fortnite bandwagon community serves you well.  P.s. Ever since the update everythings been lagging, delayed hits, random frame rate drops, all that good stuff."

1784,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Community is the sickest, so here I have examples of any type of players:Silver haters. The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience. Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME ""GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.Common idiots. Actually press f1.I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.Tryhards. Goes without any words :>Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, retard etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say ""go away"" instead. Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question ""Русские есть?"". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it. Thank you for your attention. Now you know what Counter-Strike: Global Offending is."
1785,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"This game is an excellent game, and I enjoy it very much. However  I would not recommend this game to anyone else.The community of this game is rude, cruel, and out to ruin your day. They will ridicule you for your every mistake, loose your games intentionally, and try to break you down. The problem with the community is not everyone, but is a large enough population to effect you."

I play it like its call of duty4. Dan doesnt like playing with me5. Harry cant use anything except the dak dak6. Adam has played nearly 70+ hours more than me even though we bought it at the same time7. Double zooming is for scrubs8. Paul's a Cuunt9. Michael screams like a girl10.

1787,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"They don't care about players or the game, they just care about making money, as such they'll just break the game time and time again then spend 6 months finally getting it to a great point, only to break it again.Welcome to Valve doesn't care presents ""Revolver-Strike: Revolver Offensive"".Also they only put in the revolver so people wouldn't notice the rifle changes which are stupid AF."
1788,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Well I have 200+ hours on this game, and I don't know why but hey, here's a review.Pros:+Has the option of competitive+Fairly Balanced+No Game Changing items+Fair Economy (Skins and Items)+Easy to setup (Lobbies with Friends, Custom Crosshairs/Changing Viewmodels)+No way to gain an advantage (Except Skill)+Good Anti-Cheat and Overwatch+Teamwork is neededCons:-Very Toxic, occasionally helpful, community. (Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!Neutrals:(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate."
1789,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"One of the most addicting and fun games to play to date! :) Always keeps updating,new skins are being added.And you will spend many many hours in :) just keep in mind when buying it it's competetive and people can and will probably yell at you for the silliest things ever."
1790,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"i seriously hate when valve put free to play on their games like TF2, but this is WORSE. Now this game will be filled with hackers and other exploiters! And this also means that i wasted my 20 dollars on this! ANd plz fix the  hacks in the discription there is valve security system but i doesnt do s**t! But its still a good game..."
1791,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Counter strike for kids! I mean.....(Activates deep manly voice) Counter strike GLOBAL OFFENSIVE  - it now includes unrealistic cartoony weapon skins perfect for that awsome Tactical anti-terrorism immersion that you can buy by using your mom's money!This game comes free with : More hackersAlot of ppl screaming and cursing in russian.People who claims they have slept with your mother.Unfair matchmaking.Tons of updates.But realy now: The game fixed alot of issues 1.6 had and makes it one of the world best competetive game ever. I'm glad they added the workshop until i found out that the only way to use an item in the workshop is when it gets imported by Valve in the game.So that is one problem.Instead of doing it the way left 4 dead 2 was doing the workshop became a toy making factory because the majority of the people upvotes Borderlands 2 style of weapon camo's.You will finaly see yourself spending alot of hours consentrating on the screen and doing workout with your fingers. When i bought the game it was playable on my laptop with around 40-75 fps. After the workshop update it got worse every time. now i can barely get 30 fps.If there was a way to dissable all the distracting skins and give fps a boost i would buy itTry out insurgency, its a great game to step over from arcady style of shooters"

1793,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"I try to make this as short as possible, but there will still be some lines of text:I bought this game near the date of the release. My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games.Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun.BUT - I was banned (a so called ""cooldown"") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf ""feature"".After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others.You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review.I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?!I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do.To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers.This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve!And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a ""win"".So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system.This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture.You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins.This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame.By the way:Contacting the Valve Support ends up in getting an automatic response, saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system.Maybe Valve invests more time in counting money these days...."
1794,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Thi was the last straw.This is it, I will refuse to play CS:GO again with this broken new Prime system which makes it even cheaper for cheater to fix a new account.Earlier you had to play like a fool to gain Prime status which in return made Prime more secure from cheaters, since it took a long time to get it AND you had to add your phonenumbers which made it more inconvinent for those who makes new account just for cheating.But now  you can just start a new account and pay for a new prime status which is next to nothing.After all these years with CS, I finally let it die and put it to rest in my recycle bin, refuse to look back before they fix this, I hope more people do this as well to show these money grabbers that we won't stand for this.Thanks for these last 15 years Gabe and I will end this review with this, would NOT recommend this game for new players."
1795,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Awesome game, has a real competitive feeling and it's actually quite fun with the right players but on the other side it's really annoying when it comes to the fact that there's 90% of players in the game that are mentally ill, bad-mannered, and have some sort of itch to insult and mock females for their own pleasure, and lastly the rank disappears after a certain time of inactivity, sadly it doesn't just disappear but also your rank decreases a bit far and you'll have to climb up once again! In general I loved it, and I've always had fun playing it especially that I'm usually queuing up with my girl even with some of the horrible sides of the game I still recommend it mainly with friends!

1798,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Amazingly enough, this game keeps making you more and more furious about how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it is.It starts with hackers, a lot of them, so much so that until you cross the silver barrier, the servers will be crawling with hackers.Second is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ servers, they're soo bad sometimes that neither you or the opposite team are able to play and both teams keep spamming the chat with rage comments on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ srevers, now with panorama you cannot even report servers if they're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, taking it to a whole new level.Third, worst updates possible, I don't get it if they're trying to fix the game with updates or ruin it, specially with the latest 'PANORAMA' update which has crippled everyone's performance, whether it be ping, loss or fps, everything is just went downhill since then.Fourth, worst customer support, REMEMBER, if you're facing an issue with the game, ITS YOUR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ HARDWARE AND YOUR â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ INTERNET, NOT THE VALVE, THEY'RE PERFECT. They literally take the apple approach to performance issues with the game, instead of helping you optimize the game, they'll recommend going to a technician to help optimize the game and spend money there, coz the money YOU give to buy the game doesn't include tech support.Fifth, though this can be included in performance issue, but there's times when the game will straight up freeze upon seeing an enemy or wont register hits even if you empty the whole magzine on their faces.Only get the game if it is a gift or it's on sale, it doesn't worth the full price.Review update: Right after I wrote the review I got ""some"" hacks which would help me aim and wall. And played till I got VAC ban which is for 250hrs and going from SEM to LEM, being a waller myself, I can gaurantee upon that atleast 50% people have vision assist of some kind and atleast 30% have some kind of trigger/aim assist. I wanted to prove that anyone can hack easily in this game, even with free hacks, which I used and can play for longer periods of time undetected. I got overwatch ban just because I got bored of it and started raging, if it weren't for that I could have reached to GE very easily."
1799,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"First Off... Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken.They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUYskins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free?  The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the ""season pass"".  You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content. CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it.Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking...

1801,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"I used to recommend this game but I can't anymore. CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: Pistols desperately need balance. Netcode and servers are horrible.VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience."

1809,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive used to be a great game, but constant bad updates and the toxic playerbase have ruined it. The competitive aspect used to seem like a good thing, but people take this game way too seriously and will lash out at you if you do anything even slightly wrong, and then on the other hand there are people who don't take it seriously enough and join competitive games just to annoy the people who take it seriously. There is no balance to this, you will hardly ever find a good team that you enjoy playing with.Maps - There may seem like a decent selection of maps to choose from, but there are only a select few which actually get played, and those are the old maps which most people have played thousands of times so it may be hard to get into, you may even feel discouraged.Not P2W - This game isn't pay to win, there are only weapon/glove skins which are purely cosmetic or different knives which ultimately all do the same thing, there has been a lot of controversy in the past about this kind of system being available to kids, there are cases where children steal their parents credit card just to buy skins.Many of the recent updates over the past year or so have been garbage, with many maps being added which almost never get played after a week, along with glove skins and other items so that valve can make money. I feel like this game has been abandoned by the developers, and now they primarily use it as another way to make easy money, completely disregarding the loyal playerbase and professional players.Smurfs (an experienced player using a new account to face lower ranks) and hackers are a pretty big problem in this game, and despite valves many failed attempts at combating the issue almost nothing has changed. Valves anti-cheat is garbage, and if you do end up getting this game, I would reccomend either faceit or ESEA, because their anti-cheat is a lot better and you generally face better players than if you were to play regular competitive.Although this game used to be a lot of fun to play competitively with friends, I can not reccomend it in it's current state, in my eyes this game is dying and after putting just over 1000 hours into it, I am ready to never play it again.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)"

I sometimes break my table but its ok, my mammy always gets me stuff so im good. I also break other things, but i still get new stuff.Best way to play this game is if you take a walk then do some squads and then proceed to play a little bit of deathmatch where you can hear grim russians talking a little bit of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ language.This is also a very good start of the day to me. I love spamming with radio commands to the point where my team tries to kick me, sadly they cant. I always play with a lad who is always there to back me up, and he always votes no so i keep on spamming radio commands! Sometimes i dont play too good but its okay i just play the next day. i like to use the sniper Ayy double you Pee <3 becauase back in the good olde days i used to play mw2 where i was a professional amateur quickscoper. There is also guns like the ak but i dont like that because the bullets go up and thats not fun for me when i shoot.i haf ben playing a little bit of cs for a while and im actually global max rank.

Prepare yourself, for a poorly balanced bug filled experience full of hackers and microtransactions. Get ready to play with Russians with terrible mics who cant speak english but who the game matches you up with anyway and 12 year olds with literal down syndrome while the game constantly shoves crates on to you to try and coerce you into gambling for silly skins and dumb stickers that cost like 3.00 bucks a pop. Whats that? Why are there no sprays? You silly! Valve saw that and decided it was just too fun and not making them enough money, now you get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ pre-made sprays that you get to pay for AND are limited use! Isnt that great? I cant believe its not free2play!All in all CS:GO is a giant money making scheme where literally anything you do makes Valve money so that means they dont even have to work on the game themselves since the skin makers and mappers do everything for them, so all valve needs to do is leech off of the community itself!

Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough to get a title hacker.This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this.Rating 9/10"

1825,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"I can remember the days when playing this game was actually fun. Now, it simply is not. Not just in Silver league, where people either troll constantly even if you're top fragging and you're the only one actually trying, hacking or smurfing from much higher ranks.Every game makes me angry. I play against LEM smurfs, Globals smurfs, even the good ol' Silver Elite Master smurfs who still manage to destroy everyone. I spoke with some Globals and they all decided to smurf because the game became unplayable. Too many hackers trying to be bette than everyone else. The same can be said for every other tier. It is nothing short of PATHETIC. Don't get me wrong, I learned my lesson after getting VACed a long time ago, and now I'm part of the suffering demographic of the CS:GO community. Every game I get trolled. Every game I get annihilated by players who belong in much higher tiers but still enjoy destroying the players who still need to practise giving accurate callouts. Nothing I have said so far has been hyperbolized, this is actually how the game is now.Hackers not getting banned. Smurfs having fun wreaking havoc and trolls jumping in front of you every time you shoot so you kill them and get kicked. These low-lives even gang up on you once they know you're getting angry. Next thing you know you're being body blocked all over the place and the only thing you can do is beg for a kick. I don't even have 200 hours on this account yet and the past 20-30 have been nothing but the same puerile crap. 30 year old adults acting like babies. At least the 12 year olds, even with the squeaky voices and diametrical tempers, actually try to win. Every time I log on, I have a positive mindset and feel like both having fun and winning. Then I meet the 3 types of players I just talked about. Not to mention that after the game is over, you're glad because you get the part ways and play another game with other players that won't give you a hard time. Oh wait, no you don't. You get matched up with the very same players over and over again unless you take a 20 minute break to ensure that you truly meet other players. And the cycle continues.This is not fun. If you already have the game, can't say anything you don't already know and agree with. If you're looking to buy it, don't. Go play some games that are actually worth your time. Don't think for a second you'll get the same games and players you see on the pro players' videos on youtube, because you sure as hell will not. This game is no longer enjoyable. I know that I am bad and that's why I'm not Gold Nova let alone Silver 3. But at least I actually try to play the game, to communicate and teach the basics to the ones that are new to this game. How many reports have I sent out for griefing? And how many have been dealt with? I'm more than confident that the answer is not a single one. Buy the game if you want, I obviously can't stop you. But think it through. Do you want to spend 16 bucks for hours of just being constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off?"
1826,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"This game is valve's attempt to cash in on the CS franchise name while doing nothing to add value to the game besides stupid cosmetic stuff. The same crap that ruined team fortress 2. A matchmaking system for tryhards? Oh there aren't a million of those already in existence for the other CS games - the ones that actually were competative - that work a hell of a lot better.  This is valve's strategy now - do nothing, sell, profit. This game is, for all intents and purposes, the worst CS ever made. It's a reskin of CSS with a whole lot of bugs and technical issues. But fall for the trap if you want to play valve's game!"

1829,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Gotta say dissapointing game. Totally boring, unplayable with random people, and it takes someone with tons of patience to play. The action is very limited, and it requires a lot of boring camping to accompish anything. You'd need to have friends and nothing better to do to make this game even bearable. Not worth the money."
1830,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"This game went from good to horrible over the last year. Updates were done to involve new cases to produce this company money instead of improving this game. Every other game, free to play games, bought games anything is improving and granting a better experience, while this game remains on the same point and even goes back, by those unnecessary sound updates. Cheating players continue with their hacks,  bad tickrates are not getting fixed, instead new stickers and pins are realeased. Overall this game is no more playable at all, it deserve this huge drop of players wanting to play this bad game.Will not play this again, this game is definetly done for me."
1831,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Global Offensive is the latest franchise in Counter Strike. Awesome new layout in the main menu and the same goes for the buy screen when the start of a match. After each match, the weapons that you are currently using will be load up on ammo automatically. There are several new weapons in this franchise, so...you can look forward on using all the weapons. Another thing that is new in this game will be the weapon camos, I am not 100% sure on how to get this....but from what I've heard from my friends...you can keep on playing the game until you unlock new camos in-game or you can make your own unique camos in the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop. There are 5 modes in this game: Demolition, Arms Race, Competitive, Casual and Deathmatch. New maps are added in the game or...you can choose to download extra new maps from the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop for more fun!! I recommend on buying this game when it goes on sale!"
1832,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time."

1835,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY."
1836,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Lets ignore the aggressive silvers and *cough* Russians *cough* and focus on some positive aspects:Gameplay 9/10The gameplay itself is on par with perfection, with customization options such as crosshair (shape, size, color ect), left or right handed play and of course the beautiful console interface which makes everything just THAT more simple. Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot.Graphics 8/10The graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo.Sound and voice acting 10/10Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the ""Terrorists Win"" and ""Counter-Terrorists Win"" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥BLYET"" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve!Game physics 8/10Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)Community 6/10Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH!

1838,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"CS: GO makes my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tingle with pain. When I get a headshot I wince with a burning sensation in my testicles. I realized this game is not healthy to play, one reason being I recently installed a rop hanging from my ceiling just incase i get demoted to silver elite. My mom does not approve. Everytime I get killed I cut a little slit in my arm to hopefully teach me not to die. It has not been working and I have gone into a deep depression. I do not recemmend purchasing this game that infects you with a spite to kill yourself and other, and that creates a void that only gets filled from winning matches and getting promoted. But makes an even bigger void when you get demoted and lose. Please dont buy this game if you want a happy life free of suicidal thoughts."
1839,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a tactical competitive first person shooter.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.   Aspect Score (/10)   Gameplay 10   Graphics & Optimisation 6   Additional Content 10   Value 10   Pay to win? No   OVERALL 10 Notes: I rate this game to be the best FPS game I have ever played!!!

1847,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"So, after 1000 Hours of this game, I know pretty much all I need to know for a review. This game is amazing and all, but there are a couple flaws. I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank.

1850,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,The Game is more worried about making $$$ and making skins which in turn = more $$$. Then getting rid of the cheaters and people that exploit the game. The only thing that was remotely fun about the game was the skin trading. You could get some skins then trade them up and sometimes get a skin worth enough $$$ to sell on the steam market to buy a new game. But now if you start with a 2-3$ skin and you want to trade your way up to a knife or another skin it will take years only being able to trade a skin every 7 days. RIP any fun left in this game
1851,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017, What I have learnt from this game: *How to be toxic*Ezzzy Pzzy Lemon Squizzy*Wasting time is very easy*Blaming mates in solo queue*Trash talking*Skins = Skills♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'Rush B'*Ranks are everything 
1852,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,the battle royal mode just seems like a gimic to follow the band wagon of battle royal and they pretty much screwed over the people who actually perchased this game by making it free at least warn us before we buy it and now it seems there are more hackers thanks valve.
1853,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Sure it's fun, at first.The game goes from fun to frustrating quickly, the gameplay is rather simple, but that's not the problem.Don't expect a game that is fun at first, also don't expect the game to be fun at all.The problem is how bad competitivie is, it's more fun to do homework than it is to play a game of competitive against a hacker. It doesn't help that the game is only fun less than 50% of the timeInvest your time in something else than this sinkhole. Learn how to code or just do your homework, you will have a better time and you will be more happy in the long run. You shouldn't have to invest 500 hours+ into a game for it to start being fun"

1855,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"This review comes from a man who played cs 1.6 for years and more than 600hours on CS:GO.This game is a fun game ONLY if you play with a group, ideally of 5 people. Otherwise, this game is UTTER GARBAGE.The matchmaking is so broken that I can't even describe it. Even if it might seem balanced, you only get to play a ""balanced"" game 1 every 20-30 games, and even then there's a pretty high chance you'll end up with one of the following people: a retard, a russian who doesn't speak english, a troll, a hacker.The rest of the games are either 16:1 in your favor, or 1:16 against you. And trust me, the ones you lose with scores like 10:16 are the worst games, cause this game TRULY gets the best out of you. For instance, if you play for about 3 hours CS, you'll need around 4 to let the tension this game creates blow off. It's unreal! If I have to spend time in online multiplayer games, it will definitely not be CS:GO, LOL, DOTA2 and other multiplayer teamgames, cause the community and the vast majority of the playerpool (around 80%) IS GARBAGE.

1858,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"boring, basically bare bone shooter on same maps. The only variety you can get is with skins for your guns (and I suspect that's the only reason why CS:GO community is still alive). Even after 2000000 hours of gameplay you will be on same map doing same ""mission"" with same guns and same 10 y.o. kids who can't keep their mouths shut. In 10 minutes of the match you'll hear their ""stories of life"", lots of strong language with poor accent and there's no hope to enjoy this utterly boring thing.I've got it on sale with -50% off and I feel robbed, This game by content and by gameplay is worse than any indie game under 5 dollars."

1860,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"If you join a pub server and scroll through the players you'll probably find at least one more or less blatant waller, and you can rest assured VAC isn't going to detect their tutorial copy paste cheats any time soon. You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat, and there's more than one competing platform. Gun balance is what it is, it comes and goes with Valves seemingly random patches. Some changes the community agrees with, some it doesn't, not like the community can always even agree with itself. Pistols are stronger than I'd like, certainly stronger than in previous titles. Acceleration and player speed are quite quick, which sometimes leads to frustrating experiences with getting dicked on by a strafe spamming pistol player.Speaking of frustrating experiences, it's hard to blame Valve for the playerbase, but still I wish there was something to be done about it. Mostly matchmaking gives you cool teammates, but sometimes you face a tirade of rage and abuse without any recourse. I'm not sure the reports actually do anything.You could say there's a lot of customizability what with the cosmetics, skins and sprays and such. It's just that you used to be able to download them from fpsbanana but Valve has figured out a way to turn that into a revenue stream. Good for them, money sink for others. Granted, you don't need cosmetics but I think it's safe to say most like to have a few. I have mixed feelings.At it's core CS:GO is a solid competitive team FPS with a lot of gameplay depth, good map pool, active playerbase and lots to learn and room to improve yourself. There's just many little pitfalls. I think a lot of people will end up spending more time on this game than they initially expected. I don't know if I'd recommend it. You get really into it and then it just becomes too frustrating."
1861,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"After several hours in this game, all I can say is that this game has the absolute worst community I have EVER SEEN in my entire life, and worse than Call of Duty's, Battlefield's, PAYDAY 2's, Team Fortress 2's, or Left 4 Dead's.CS:GO's community is the living embodiment of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the gaming community.You get insulted by either your teammates or the enemy team for EVERY little thing, on Casual, and ESPECIALLY in Competitive, and you can't mute them either because you have to somehow find some useful information that's buried underneath the childish and immature insults from these manchildren and kids that love talking♥♥♥♥♥♥because you can't physicallly punch them in the face in real life because of distance.The virginity, girlfriendless, sexism (I've seen really immature and horny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that prey on girls, and I've also seen stupid, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, attention seeking girls on this game as well that bait guys), anti-social, fanboyism, nerdism, sociopathy, childishness, manchildishness, and immaturity are at maximum here in this game.Then there's these clutch or kick nerds that can't ever give you a ♥♥♥♥ing chance and are constantly pressuring you and cause you to fail, then they put up a votekick against you and kick you out for losing ONE round even though you're most likely leading and carrying the entire team, and winning the match as well, and it's worse if you're in a Competitive match when this happens because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cooldown system, which is another issue with this game. You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that♥♥♥♥♥♥can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so goddamn much to you.And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you. And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.Valve clearly doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this♥♥♥♥♥♥actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBNjy5Ahg8And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community."

1863,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"This game is the game that every FPS should aspire to be. Excellent gameplay, extremely large range of minigames or various other game modes that you can play if you're not satisfied with the flagship game modes. I.e Classic 5v5 competitive games. The game is quite infested with skin related crap, but that's half the fun for some players and it's essentially harmless as it doesn't change gameplay in any way. All items are cosmetic and don't offer any advantages. Additions to this game from outside the official development team also offer another avenue for players. Especially those seeking competitive gaming; Several organisations offer the chance to play on 128 Tick 5v5 matchmaking servers instead of the regular 64 tick Valve Official servers. Some of these organisations will request a small monthly fee for this priviledge, others are free. This game has something for everyone."

You'll rage quit, you'll uninstall, you'll scream, you'll team kill, you'll swear, you'll want to hunt down the kid who got a lucky shot on you.But you'll always, always come back."

There is a thin line from hating and loving this game, but after the long hours spent I can assure you that this game is addicting, memorable and hell of fun.

1868,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"COMMUNITY The biggest problem of this game.  Community is full of Russians, screaming kids, Russians and again, you won't believe me - screaming kids. About 80% (maybe more) of my games I played with Russians was pure cancer. They didn't speak English, just &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥"" and other sh*ts.  This also applies with kids - I don't know, how many times I heard 11/12 yo kids who f*cked my mother, funny :), isn't it? You can have a good score, like 36/15, you can win 9 rounds on harder side, you can sacrifice your soul to win, but still, with team score 14/9 on better side you can LOSE. Why, because they aren't able to do something good. Situations, when they want to kick you:They want to kick you, if you don't clutch 1v5.They want to kick you, if you don't speak their language.They want to kick you, if you are 30 seconds AFK. They want to kick you, if you are ahead of them.They want to kick you, if you are behind them. ( mostly if  they use only P90)They want to kick you, if you are 1v5 and you want to save an AWP or other expensive gun.AND STORY CONTINUES........I really recommend to find a friends and play together.SKINSIn game you can buy skins. Nice, you can ""upgrade"" your game how you want. But there fun ENDS. Do you want some beauty skin on an USP? - Pay about 5€!Do you want some beauty skin on M4/AK47? - Pay 10+€!Do you want some beauty skin on an AWP? - Pay  20+€!NOT ENOUGH? Do you want some beauty skin on Knife? -♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet and bank account and PAY 300+€!!No, I am not kidding. 300€ for pixels into game, that costs 10€. Ridiculous? Yes, I know. VALVE's RANKING SYSTEMAnother thing you should know until you start play competetive. Believe me, rank in this game doesn't show your right skill. There are a lot of boosted accounts. You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN. Yes, it can happen, when you play competetive.VALVE ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM (VAC) Of course, they improved it, but still VAC is quite broken. Because there are a lot of hackers. And how you going upper and upper, the worst it gets. SMURFSMaybe I should add this topic to COMMUNITY, but it's that important, so it deserves separated topic. I think, there are more and more and way more smurfs than before. It's a ""good feel"", if you get 3x oneshot headshot in row by 1 man. So, you want check out his profile, clearly for sure and then you see: Lvl 1 profile without avatar, only with 1 game - CS:GO with about 60/100 hours on it. I don't get, why do they create new Steam profile, buy CS:GO and play against weaker players. They gotta to kill lower ranks to get a higher ego? Why do they not play on FACEIT/ESEA? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, if you want to get the cancer, but you dont even smoke and these included cons don't matter for ya - BUY IT! :)But the game itself is great :)MY OVERAL RATING - 5/10"

1870,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"This game is one of the best balanced tactical games that I have seen. Though a reskin and slight rebalance of an old series (around 16 years old) it preforms beautifully, and provides a great experience of two teams sharing a playing field to battle wits and skill. The simplicity with which one can begin playing allows almost everyone to play and enjoy the game. The details of the game, the same since the year 2000, bring such minute differences between the skilled and the amateur that the skill ceiling is nearly unreachable. The only  poor quality of this game is the toxicity of the players. This game is great for beginners and elites of FPS gaming alike, but those who are sensitive may want to get a slightly thicker skin before playing, as any and all mistakes in this game are looked down on harshly by the majority."

1872,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013,"The latest installment in Valve's Counter-Strike series brings us great, addicting gameplay, a colourful, alive world in a game that combines great mechanics, with great performance. It is my second most played game, soon to become the first. The item drop system is similar to the one in Team Fortress 2. At the end of a match you may or may not receive an item. A skin, a weapon case, you never know !    The best way to play, is to play competitively. The game has a Matchmaking system, that finds you a nearby server to play on, with 9 other players to fill your 5v5 match. This is where you have to play good, where you have to win.   After your first few matches, you will be given a Skill Group. That, is your rank. It's based on your  K / D ratio, and the amount of wins and consecutive wins you've had in previous matches. The Matchmaking system's job is to match you with players of your level. If you don't wanna play serious, though, you can still hop in the thousands of servers with random stuff! Deathrun, Zombie Survival, Deathmatch, you name it! It's still tons of fun. But the real deal is in Competitive.    So, what are you waiting for? GET IT !Unsurprisingly, I give it a 10 / 10 "

1875,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Valve doesn't do anything about the serious problem about csgo:  HACKS.  Games are full of hackers and developers of the game don't do anything about it, VAC waves are just a  joke  nothing changes, until they fix the hack problem in the game i don't see CSGO as an  esport game.  It's just a game that some kid yells at you, and the other team types ""ez your so ezz"" at the end of every game. This review will stay here until they improve their VAC system or at least they do  something  about it. So,  NO  I don't  recommend  you to buy this game until they fix the big issue about hackers.------------------------------------------------------------Edit: Still there is no improvement whatsoever. (18.02.2017)Edit 2: There's a player who uses aim-lock and wall hack scripts in both teams every 8 out of 10 matches i play in MM, its worse than before now. (14.04.2017)Edit 3: There's been a  VAC  wave again, around  40k people  got banned in one day. I don't see that many  cheaters  in my games anymore, which leaves questions in my mind... If an anti-cheat system could spot 40k hackers in one day, couldn't it spot them before as they cheat on every match they play? Do we need to have these VAC waves again and again? (11.07.2017)"
1876,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013,"This is a great addition to the CS series. The maps look fresh, the models are great, and the gameplay is as tight as ever. The competitive mode offers a very quick way to find (relatively) balanced matches. One drawback though is the frame-rate issues the original Arms Deal update introduced with all the gun skins, which many are experiencing and Valve don't really seem to be looking to fix any time soon. 2018 edit: Over time I have found the performance less of an issue with each upgrade of my hardware, but it appears Valve never bothered specifically addressed this themselves as they focused on fleshing out the microtransaction market instead."

1878,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"This game is slowly dying. Here's whyPlayers: The community is getting worse and worse, as more and more Smurfers and Cheaters are coming in and Valve is doing nothing against that.Mechanics: For a game as big as CS:GO it's just sad. Many hits don't register, and that's because 64Tick-Servers and bad Hitboxes, but again, Valve does nothing.Anti-Cheat: VAC (Valve-Allows-Cheaters) is like nonexistent. Cheaters can Spinbot and OBVIOUSLY cheat, because VAC just doesn't work. If you want a working AntiCheat go play ESEA or Face.it, their AntiCheat does work.All in all, things need to change for this game to be fun for many people again, sadly, it still generates infinite money and probably won't die the next years... Changes would really be good."
1879,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Worst community ever. People are always yelling or playing music in the mic, throwing around insults, complaining about everything (you're doing too good, you're doing too bad, they don't like the weapon you're using, etc) and voting to kick people for no reason. I muted my mic, but then they get mad, because you cant hear them and yeah.Can't say I'm a fan of bullets not going toward your crosshair either, because of the recoil ""bullet patterns"". It's a problem since they're not random, so you're forced to learn them if you want to compete, because everyone else knows them. So in those situations where you want to hold down the fire button for longer than 1 second during close range combat and go for a headshot, you have to aim at their feet, then a little to the left, then the right. It's incredibly frustrating. Most of the time, you'll get beat by someone who took the time to download the recoil bullet pattern training map and mastered it.So if you have nothing, but free time to play this game everyday, feel like ""training"" and can deal with the overwhelming bad community, then this might be for you. Otherwise, I suggest not wasting your time."
1880,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"This game is full of hackers, and Valve just help them by making the game free-to-play. Meanwhile me as an Overwatch have to work for free reviewing match after match full of hackers."
1881,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Valve turned this game into a sausage fest... with hats.Currently, the game has taken on a F2P/P2W grind-to-collect rare items, playtime incentive system, which gives the game a cheap social-media-tool feel. The 'hat system' is a clear indication that it is time to move on, some 15 years after the creation of the original, and break free of the stale CS formula. Bring something new and engaging to the table... please leave your hats at home.(This game was decent when first it came out and a year or so after - it was a blast teaming up with randoms and making friends to play competitive. The competitive mode really brought the best out of the what the game had to offer.)On the upside, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege may be the answer to the new competitive FPS standard, the breath of fresh air that people have been waiting for.*Please feel free to thumb down this review, if CS:GO is the only game you've ever played*"

The game that we all should love.The competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork, skill and tactics, its nice that team with a leader (A guy that command his/her teamates via team chat or voice chat) will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader. Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever. Recommended to all competitive and also casual players !PS: You can actually earned money from this game item drop, so you can actually have fun and earned money. :D"
1883,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"You know that one saying that goes, ""Don't hate the player, hate the game?"" Yeah well with me and CSGO, it's basically don't hate the game, hate the players.  I love the game but wow is the community one of the most toxic, rude, and stupid I have ever experienced"
1884,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"CG:GO is a blast to the past; a nod to the old-school days of the late 90's, and it's more than welcome in my gaming livery. Whilst I love COD and Titanfall, there's something uniquely compelling about starting up a match of CS:GO, with it's deliberate and stayed pacing, and it's risk vs reward gameplay mechanics, it's no wonder this game has taken off for the 3rd time in it's lifecycle.It's popular right now for a reason, and that reason is good.A must-buy."
1885,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"It's a great, fun game, but:Competitive matchmaking in the Silver ranks would be a lot more enjoyable if they weren't filled with the following players (keep in mind you will find some people in the higher ranks acting like this. Just look up a few Youtube videos that recorded some arguments on CSGO):1) Mr. L33t, the egotistical, temperamental♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who blames everything on you or other teammates-People like Mr. L33t think they're good. They're ones who feel entitled to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because they think their skill will win the game anyway. Imagine the following scenario, okay? Here it goes: you're playing a match defending a bombsite on the Terrorist side. Mr. L33t is carefully watching the bombsite's right flank as a sniper. An enemy player suddenly appears, who also has a sniper rifle. Mr. L33t and the enemy player try to one shot each other. Since you don't want to peak the sniper and get killed insantly, you hang back at the bomb site and play it smart like your other teammates. Mr. L33t, on the other hand, wants to get that kill so bad that he ends up getting sloppy. Then Mr. L33t dies. Soon enough, you end up being the last living member of your team, and you're still hiding. Meanwhile, the enemy team also has only one member after all the fighting.Now, you know this guy has a sniper rifle, so you ain't going to peak. Of course, there's a problem. He can approach you from multiple sides. You have two choices to approach this situation:A: You can take a risk and look for him, and if you're lucky enough, kill him. However, the downside to this decision is that if you end up dying, Mr. L33t will say ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE CAMPED!B: You can continue hiding in the same spot and hope to ambush them. However, if the enemy player has a good guess that you're hiding in that spot, he will prefire the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and kill you. If you die, Mr. L33t will say something along the lines of ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE PEAKED AND LOOKED FOR HIM!"" Or he will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you for not prefiring, even though if you did, you would never have hit the enemy player and instead give away your exact position, so even though the enemy player had a guess of where you're hiding, now he knows for sure. So which choice is the right choice? None, because you never had a chance to kill him in the first place and would die regardless. Meanwhile, Mr. L33t will be busy telling the whole team to join his circle jerk of hate, because clearly you are a bad player for not being able to kill him.You could, of course, tell Mr. L33t that if he were such a good player, he would have killed him long before it even became a problem, but it's clearly not his fault because he's the most important snowflake on this team. And remember the last round he tried to clutch as the last player? Yeah, he didn't clutch that match either, and he did far worse than you at it, but he decided to ♥♥♥♥♥ at his teammates anyway for not giving him proper call outs, even though that's exactly what you did. What did this guy do? He didn't give you ANY call outs. You know what's worse than playing on a team with Mr. L33t? Playing a game with 2 or more Mr. L33ts. Let the vote kick commence, but it's not like having them kick you off the team will make any difference because they're going to lose the competitve game anyway.2) Mic Spamming Mikey, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who spams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound loops, songs, memes, and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BS in a comp match who wonders why the team can't hear any callouts.You would think Mic Spamming Mikey is a troll, but unlike other mic spammers, Mikey is taking this game half-seriously, so he's putting in some effort to win, although it's not much, mind you...Basically Mikey thinks everyone enjoys the BS he ♥♥♥♥♥ out of his mic, because listening to his stupid songs that have lyrics like ""touch muh wang wang"" and ""I'm so fresh you can suck muh nuts"" are clearly more important than listening to callouts. Nobody's going to be able to hear call outs with loud volume like that. Then comes the moment where a teammate dies, then Mikey says ""OMFG HOW COULD YOU NOT HEAR THE CALLOUTS? VOTEKICK!"" It's even worse if Mikey turns out to have the same personality traits that Mr. L33t has.3) Jackass Jimmy, the idiot with no sense of awareness.Jackass Jimmy isn't a noob. He's been playing this for a while. However, he still plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ so he has absolutely no excuse to be an idiot. Jackass Jimmy still doesn't know call outs, recoil patterns, the difference between camping and rushing, and a whole lot of other obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥that you need to know. Jackass Jimmy is the type of person to hear someone say ""They're rushing B! They 're rushing B!"" and still stay at bombsite A because he doesn't know how to read a map. He's the type of person to fire a gun full auto at point blank range and still not kill his intended target. He's the type of person to buy an auto sniper, only to miss every shot with it and give the enemy team a generous donation of an OP weapon after getting killed.Jackass Jimmy isn't even trying at this point.4) Trolling Tommy and Backup BillyTrolling Tommy likes to troll competitive games just to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. He'll do anything to get on your nerves, whether it's purposely playing like♥♥♥♥♥♥ getting in your face to keep you from using your gun, flashing your teammates, ""accidentally"" teamkilling you, spinning around in spawn, and a whole list of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Naturally, such behavior warrants a quick and hasty votekick, but not for Trolling Tommy. You see, Trolling Tommy always comes with another equally stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥called Backup Billy. Backup Billy also likes to troll the game, but he prefers to blend in with the crowd and act like he's not part of it. Backup Billy's job is to keep Tommy from getting votekicked, so he'll always vote no. He'll lie and tell you he voted yes, then blame it on someone else.5) Hacking Harley, the hacking piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from the enemy team who keeps you from winning.In most circumstances, hacker accusations are unfounded and usually are wrong. However, in cases where there clearly is a hacker in your competitive mach, Hacking Harley just loves to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with their aimbot, wall hacks, spinbot, whatever. Forget having their team votekick them. Those guys want a quick and easy win. Enjoy losing a competitive match that could have easily been won by you if everyone played fair and square.6) Mr. SaltyMr. Salty has a temper like Mr. L33t, but Mr. Salty doesn't brag about how good he is. Instead, he gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off over trivial things. He will team kill his teammates for accidentally shooting him, making the whole team lose the match. He'll get angry at you for trying to give him advice. Mr. Salty is the type of person who has been on a losing streak in the past couple of matches so anything will♥♥♥♥♥♥him off. P.S.Casual matches would also be more enjoyable if we didn't have the following idiots:1) Mic Spamming Mikey (he's a full blown troll here)2) Tryhard Johnson - this guy is just like Mr. L33t, except he's even ♥♥♥♥♥ier and treats casual like a competitive game. He won't give new players the chance to learn and will vote kick them on the spot if they make a mistake they can afford to make. You know, because it's casual, and people try to get practice out of it..."
1886,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Thanks, Valve! You did it,you ruined CS:GO,something I thought was impossible.   Why would you make a BR game out of this iconic franchise is beyond me.You could have just made a second br game using source engine and put another dev team on it,insted you focused your resources on a mode that nobody asked for.   Danger zone plays and feels like an indie battle-royale,cs mechanics feel weird and out of place in a genre like that.Also most of the time youre using SMG's ,pistols and shotguns which,in my opinion,lowers skill ceiling drastically.On top of that - map becomes boring and repetitive after a few games because it looks like its made in 2007 with first stable source build valve released.Last operation was over a year ago and all this time youve been working on this?!?!?Why?WTF...Valve always values community feedback ,for example - overwatch,reddit,forums,workshop etc. , but this time nobody asked for this,if anything, people were sceptical.So why would you,in a right state of mind,start working on something so controversial and uncharacteristic to cs as a god damn BR...   Now about prime and CS:GO becoming f2p...♥♥♥♥ valve.Cheater problem was bad as it is,but now since you can buy prime cheaters are going to ruin even more games because nothing stands in their way,and I dont even want to imagine all the casual PUB's which are gonna be unplayable.Even if you get eventually detected,you can simply make another account and continue cheating,there is completely 0 penalty for doing so.    This company built all this hype around a terrible update.I was hoping for Matchmaking rework,introduction of seasons and rewards,something fun ,a goal for the casual players,maybe 128 tick servers or an operation because valve was working on something BIG...Now its all gone,they are going to focus on BR  mode,update and tweak it.Because of that cs as we know will stagnate even more and eventually  perish.Thanks for spliting your dev team even more,i look forward for the next update in 2022.Thanks volvo :)RIP CSGO 6/12/2018goodnight,sweet prince..."

1889,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"This game is a cheatfest, and Valve takes no action to make it better. Prime accounts? LOL! Cheater plays, cheater gets banned, cheater makes new account, cheater makes that account Prime.VAC is always too late, ranks are lost, accounts are rebought.80% of every competitive game at this point either has a hacker or a griefer in it."
1890,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Until Valve come up with a better matchmaking method (with almost 4 years since the release, I'd say there are no such plans) you'll be better off wasting your time and emotional balance elsewhere. Competitive is crowded with smurfs, poisonous jerks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who find it amusing to ruin their team's match on purpose, cheaters and kids. To be fair, kids are probably the most pleasant group to play with cause they mostly try to play well, even if they can't. If you play really, really well - you may be able to ignore the first 2 groups. The rest will still be there.My biggest complaint towards competitive gameplay is that reporting people doesn't do much, especially reporting for offensive voice / text chat - it's always been merely a placebo button. Global Offensive jokes aside, you cannot imagine how fed up I am with people losing their♥♥♥♥♥♥when I say I am Russian, even if I carry the game and never insult anyone or talk about politics. I'm not going to lie about my nationality to play with a bunch of ignorant frustrated teenagers. What’s funniest – all of that mostly comes from other Europoors who everyone else would confuse with Russians anyway.Top it up with all the more frequent lags, server instability and general lack of communication from devs on server downtimes and updates, and you’ll have CS:GO. It doesn’t mean you can’t still enjoy this game or that I will stop playing it. It’s just very hard to do so unless you play in a full premade team and rank in the top 25% at least."
1891,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"I can't recommend this game after playing +650 hours, the community isn't supportive or fun to play with anymore, the skins and ""mission books"" are just a way to keep making money off the same product that a very large community bought. Source use to be fun when you hop into a server and you may or may not find the random a$$hole, but most people where very accepting and use to actually have great conversations and great games...but now its full of intense competitiveness that just makes people upset if you don't do exactly what they tell you when they tell you, even if you do what they tell you they will figure out a way that its still somehow your fault and not theirs at all.I do like competitive, but people (and trolls) need to lighten up. I know this part of the game and part of that ranking system...but that's why I'm there too. I don't just hop in for fun, I'm still looking for the ""W"". It's more rare these days to find a good set of people when you go into a casual map, but numurous people I know have had to mute everyone because again no one has anything productive or positive to say and it definitely takes away from the game. Go play dirty bomb, or...well any other FPS other then this, cause its either going to: A) waste all your time and money or B) waste your breath on this deteriorating community.UPDATE 05/10/2016:The community continues to not be supportive and never want to have fun, just win, even on casual. Casual is a place where people are suppost to practise and improve on their game, but when players begin to argue and complain (again) on ways, they do not agree with others and they immediately kick you from the game. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You are better off finding a brand new game with people who care about the community and to further their own fun while inviting others to do the same. Oh, and if you have a stat-trak and want to switch to a new one without losing your kills it will cost you MORE MONEY ($1.30) TO SWITCH A SIMPLE NUMBER COUNTER. THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MOENY, ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS GAME/COMPANY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. I should mention the game is great (minus the hackers, trolls and things like the SSG jump shot kill [which I love] [They took this out in a later update]) if you're just looking to pass some time/hours and just want to blow peoples heads off, go for it.UPDATE 09/30/2016:I won't deny the AK ""sounds more real"" (barely), but all these new sounds make the guns sound like toys especially the M4A1-S. More children in the middle of the day play now when they should be in school or something and casual continues to be nothing but trash players and screamers that just want to make you deaf for some reason :/ . If you play this, competative might be your best bet for fun and good people.UPDATE 11/12/2016:Just came off a competative match and the group decided to kick me because I wanted to knife the other opponent, they were a bunch of kids all below the age of 14 and had nothing constructive or nice to say at all. I'm going to ask for my money back because this is one of the worst community's to play with along with poor updates and consistently making non-broken maps more broken/""balanced"". I have been playing on and off for years now and it looks like I may stay off this game for forever because of this toxic, unsupportive cretins and terrible company/dev updates that (again) don't help with stupid updates that don't improve the game, just their wallets.UPDATE 03/07/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY):Yet again just wanted to kill time, go on for a few casual matches and (as a terrorist) CT's have nothing but awps, autos and negevs for 4 matches in a row!!! Not rounds, games...different matches...same people, same sides, same guns. Literally not worth playing anymore...literally I don't know why I bother anymore. Again, don't buy. You're better off buying ANYTHING ELSE but this terrible time waster. I know this review is long, but it's been a small reminder over the last 9 months of on and off play to just stay away, the only reason I keep coming back is just a time filler. Also, with the case drops I just sell them right away for the pennies (it's actually gotten me some good coin for some better cheaper games), it might not seem like much, but once you get that extra dollar it helps for DLC's or those pennies that push you over that ""money limit"" when buying games. I still personally don't recommend this game, but if you choose to buy it, have fun I guess :PUPDATE 09/07/17:Literally trash. Would though away if I could. All awpers in casual, no fun in competative...its a terrible game. Don't buy it.UPDATE 06/01/18:Full of A.D.H.D., nothing but office, dust 2 and some other over played ♥♥♥♥♥♥ map."
1892,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"I am sadly to say this for CS. I have been playing this game for 6 years. And I was enjoying when I played it. But this year. That CS:GO showed us how to CS die. Valve do nothing about these cheaters on the game. that mustn't to be easy to cheating in this game. If you play an unprime matchmaking, this is possible that all players in the game are hacker.On every update, we are thinking that CS:GO going to be better. But its not. There is nothing to do for hackers. Gloves, New skins, and new character view has come with updates. Valve knows that the cheaters are so much in the game. But there is no prevention. Today. I am going to uninstall the game from my computer. I have just wanted to say my complaints. Obviously I have been angry. And I can do nothing more expect this. Sincerely.-RaodiN"

1894,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"""Low spec PC is no longer supported.""﻿ wowI loved this game at first, but almost every round I play with trolls, VAC is bad, almost every game I play against spinboters and wallers or aim hackers, I watched replays and yes they were cheating. Never got notified that they got banned as i got once when i had 50 hours. Now I lose every round because i have to carry or enemy is damn good, I dont get good teamates as I would love to, they are too bad for me or 2 strong so i cant get any kills. I hate when i join game and in first half 2 of my teamates leave game. Anything isnt better with Trust mode that was added... I dont get wtf new dust 2 map is, it looks like you just used some parts of Office ( T spawn? ), Inferno ( B site), and Italy + Canals. Tunnels look almost same as tunnels in Aztec, I have to say that my fps isnt that bad for me like for other players it is, I usually have about 45-60fps in dust 2 40-50fps ( And that isnt very bad because I learned how to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop. ) Other thing I have to say for Nuke that has 25-35fps which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and what the hell is minimap and bomb sound on Nuke. I am at B site in doors room ( idk its name but its nice to hide ), and I hear bomb like it is 2 meters from me. I told my teamate that bomb is on B and after about 20 seconds we realized that it is on A... but it was too late gg wp.♥♥♥♥♥♥mapAztec got removed from game and there is achievment that says "" Win 100 rounds on Aztec "". What fu*king idiot removed Aztec and Vertigo from game. Maps werent balanced, true, but that isnt reason to remove them from game. And I dont get it why you dont bring them back with message "" We added removed maps to game because community wanted it. "" And why would you like to remove maps from competitive and make players unhappy? So people have more time to buy skins? Or write long reviews like I am doing now? You are just ruining the game with new updates. And about skins, almost all csgo profit comes from skins because some rich Americans have to buy Dragon Lore ( no hate ). Just imagine war with painted guns, unrealistic. You made skin market with in game inspect from nice tactical FPS game. And knife in game costs 5 more times then real life knife, you are just making people an idiots.Today I playied vs spinboter on Cache, and best thing is that hacker had 1400 gours in game. Idk, maybe he got hack when he had 1200 or 1300 hours, but after 200 hours in game (I just guess) this guy is still playing and ruining other people's fun. After all stupid things and toxic enemies who say ""ez ez ez"" when they win competitive match, especially if they have less kills then worst guy in my team. Also I got kicked for being the best one in game with 32 kills and ofc I got derank... All at all, I hate it because it isnt good balanced. And BOTs arent listening, I dont care about your stupid new shootgun update, like anybody will use shootguns they are sh#t in csgo and cost too much, so could you make BOTs listen and not die in first 20 seconds of the match...but no, shootguns are the most important thing ...I playied Wingman cuz I was bored and I dont get its new ranking system, something changed... Firstly I won 2 games in a row and after that lost and BOOM! I deranked to gn4 from mg1. After that I lost one more time and deranked to gn3, wow!!! After that thingie I won 3 matches and got no rankup and after that lost 1 match and deranked to gn2... WHAT THE F#Ck ?!?!?!?!?!?! I guess this is one more of VALVE'S briliant updates where you cant rankup up in Wingman and can derank if you lose only one match, Im not joking. This is for real and I dont know what is going on, I got matched against silvers as mg1 and that is reason for sure... but those guys play better then some of my friends that are mg2 or mg elite in Wingman... I swear.... They have less then 100 hours and play awesome. Well that is why I deranked wow... I wasnt playing csgo about 1 month, cuz its absolute bulls#it in my opinion. And that is the reason why game gave me to play vs silvers, I guess... and now I have Gold Nova 2 instead of MG1 with win/lose=10 ^_^Also when griefers are in my team they kill me and other teamate and just leave with 30 minutes ban, they got 30 minutes ban and we lost our ranks. That is fu*king nice Valve, fu*king nice. And after griefers leave in 3rd round, later result is 14 - 4 (for enemy)  I abandoned the match and got 24 hour ban. Well yes... Again fu#king nice Valve.One more time I got trolls in team, I found a nice chance to kick 2 of them because other 2 got kicked after they killed me on the start of first 2 rounds. After I kicked 2 of them It was 5v1 and I surrendered. When I came to lobby it said I'm banned for 7 days ""you kicked to many players""?!?!?!?... fu#k you and your stupid game!!!PS: I'm silver elite now and I was silver elite master after 20 hours in game. Logic. I have the most kills every match but I lose because my teamates are disabled idiots. Well... I hope there is someone who has same opinion as me.Sry because bad English :/"

1904,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Can't recommend it. Utterly horrid.Judging from the experience I had with this game, the community is the first crucial hole in it. Especially if you're a poor russian sod, who bought this game because your friend recommended you to do so. You'll be kicked from the server, just because guys from other countries thought that your drunk vodka dances wasn't good enough. That always grinds my gears.The gameplay is repetitive and there's nothing to talk about. I'm sure you've played it and know what i mean.Since I haven't much played it lately, there seems to be new payable merch were implemented, like: gloves, something about premium-accounts and ect. If the game tries to show the conflict between SWAT and mujaheddins, let's first get rid of the colored guns and gloves, because on the real war you won't be using any skins to show off to your mates. Soldiers on the war don't usually do that♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they have an objective to destroy the enemy forces, not showing off. The whole concept of skins seems very odd and doesn't fit in a game about the war conflicts. Also, I like the phrase ""Shop for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Merchandise"" on the Steam store page.The summary.I can't belive I spent over 300 hours in this game. The addiction that you might get from this is worse than drug addiction. Just for god sake, don't buy it. There's plenty of games that show war conflicts, like Arma 2 for example.P.S.Yesss! i've managed to give a review on this game on a different language!"

Thanks Valve for ruining everything. Also thank you for that badge I got for buying the game, it's totally like I will use it after this."
1907,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Let me start off by saying this game is good, it used to be fantastic. THe developers of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game do not give two butt♥♥♥♥s about the players, they care only about money. Instead of making this game better and fixing bugs, they add cases and sprays. At times, I question why I I still play this god awful excuse of a game. The one great thing about this community was the ability to gamble your skins, and ecspecially csgolounge. Not only did valve attempt to fully cease operations on gambling sites, they also took down csgolounge, the biggest and most reliable betting site of them all (also a personal favorite of mine). On top of these horrific displays of costumer servive by valve, they also have a ranking system that is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow that i could litterally rank up faster in the actual U.S. military. And dont even get me started about the god damn morons you find in matchmaking. I often find that 99 out of 100 of my teammates that i am randomly get queud with are absoulutely brain dead, and have little to no knowledge about the game and how it functions. Now on to a very important issue that is troubling our community, the grill (girl) population is extremely scarce, you could imagine my frustration as a man trying to get in some dank phone sex after a compettitive match. Not only this, but it seems as though the grills that are playing csgo, 1. pay no attention to my extremely rushed and desperate advances toward them. 2. grills also seem to be treated like gods in this game, (even though they are all really ♥♥♥♥ing bad) and almost always have extremely expensive inventories. And on to my final issue with this game, the man who runs the show.... yup, thats right, im talking about you Gaby boy. Gaben, also known as gay piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥fan boy obese nerd online legend real life loser-having♥♥♥♥♥Gaben has slowly destroyed this game, due to the constant uploads of new cases and operations, just so that fat bastard can get some more cash from twelve year olds around the world. GABEN DOES NOT CARE HOW ANYONE FEELS ABOUT THIS GAME, he doesn't want to improve it he just wants to keep making money, and no one is stopping him. When you think of the world's richest people, you would never think that some dumb♥♥♥♥♥obese pizza face online fangay that happens to be named Gaben would be on that list, but right now Gaben is a very powerful man, and mark my words, he will make his way to politics and put more money in his diseased sausage finger having♥♥♥♥♥hands. Anyway, to sum things up, the game is worth the buy when on sale, and is not by any means woth spending any additional money on. 6.3/10"

1910,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"there is call of duty, which has homophobic 12 year olds that rage at you at your lack of skillthen there is CS:GO, which has homophobic 20 year olds that rage at you for your lack of skill and weapon skins"
1911,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10."
1912,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Literally the worst game that ever came out. If you aren't completely sadistic and have some self respect you just keep your ♥♥♥♥ing fingers away from this terrible game. You're gonna start at the bottom of the rank lists playing against people with over 40'000 hours who literally just bought a new account to ♥♥♥♥ you up and tell you how homophobical they are, or how they banged your mum and dad and sister and brother last night. Ideally, you're gonna become better, actually you won't, but you will be sometimes carried so hard through your games that you'll manage to get to some decent ranks, where you'll get stomped because you play against people who sacrificed their girlfriends for pure reaction time and insanely inhuman skills. Talking and having fun at this stage is basically impossible, since you will have to drop down everything that might even slightly decrease your attention, e.g: Your baby, your girlfriend, the phone, the doorbell, everything. After 500 hours you'll get to the elo hell, Legendary Eagle Master, where you are gonna face off exact copies of KennyS, ApeX, olofmeister and more. The insults at this stage of the game become so heavy, that you won't be able to sleep for weeks. After a few months of playing, asking yourself WHY you play this game, you're gonna get out of LEM and become SMFC and then GE. Now you're the one whos stomping. HA! JOKE! You'll now face a ♥♥♥♥ing wallhacker or aimbotter every ♥♥♥♥ing round, people who literally spend their whole childhood playing this game since Half Life was announced, people who became one with their PC. And the worst of all...you're still going to play this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Whatever, I'm off playing a round."
1913,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013,"The ""third"" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first. "
1914,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"I cannot recommend CS:GO.Valve lacks adequate transparency in rectifying the ongoing issues present within CS:GO (i.e. cheats, game play performance, etc.). Additionally, the crawl to level 21 (i.e. a requirement to play prime account matchmaking, which slightly decreases cheating encounters) is grueling given that the number of cheaters in non-prime results in slowed leveling; competitive matchmaking consistently provides the highest XP reward, which is dependent on rounds won. Valve relies on a peer review system (i.e. Overwatch) to punish potential cheaters, which serves as a do-it-yourself solution that is supplemented with VAC (i.e. an ineffective anti-cheating solution). Cheaters are not deterred as an overwatch conviction commonly results in the individual obtaining an alternate account. Despite Valve’s profit margins being nourished by superfluous additions (stickers, temporary graffiti, skins, music kits, etc.) the game has been lacking substantial content in the form of Operations, which are accompanied by new maps. The previous operation occurred almost a year ago, which far exceeds the average time between the last six operations of five weeks. Also, the gaming community is vitriolic - there are countless incidents of bigotry, griefing, etc. – it's a Sisyphean struggle of always wanting to expect the best out of CS:GO before being unfailingly reminded of its shortcomings. After nearly 1000 hours, I was left exhausted and resigned myself to the rampant cheating - I piecemealed together my own cheat using articles from numerous public forums. Expectedly, this resulted in me being overwatch banned after countering a series of cheaters in competitive prime-matched games. This 'other side' does not provide any reprieve - even the slightest tinge of a perceived good play, whether assisted with cheats or not, provokes the veiled hackers. I give up on this game as Valve has long before me.tl;dr                                                         …………………./´¯/)                                                        ………………..,/¯../                                                        ………………./…./                                                        ………./´¯/’…’/´¯¯`·¸                                                        ………./’/…/…./……./¨¯\                                                        ……..(‘(…´…´…. ¯~/’…’)                                                        ………\……………..’…../                                                        ……….”…\………. _.·´                                                        …………\…………..(                                                        …………..\………….\… CS:GO Excessive number of cheaters primarily in matchmaking (i.e. indistinct or outright) Lack of substantial content (e.g. 1+ year to release an Operation); however, Valve will occasionally release minor fixes for the existing map pool whether aesthetic or technical Ineffective anti-cheating engine and DIY stopgap (i.e. Overwatch) Vitriolic community and ineffective counter-measures Placebo buttons (i.e. report text / voice abuse)   Low incidence of griefing convictions   Heroes of the Storm adopted an effective abuse system a few months after release – Introducing New Reporting Options and the Silence Penalty[us.battle.net] - why is CS:GO lagging behind?We view any system that generates revenue at the cost of consumer happiness as a broken system that we need to fix - Kyle Davis (Valve) - In-Game Economies in Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 Steam Dev Days 2014 A common occurrence in CS:GO [image.prntscr.com] "

1917,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"In my opinion, this game is still very young and undeveloped and all the hate against russians is stupid. I mean i'm not one to talk here i hate them sometimes aswell. I realised something when i was playing one day, the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game, where rank is more importand than having fun. How valve changed CS for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing  CS 1.6 or CSS. Back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the  servers  where flooded with ads. I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times? To me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustn't  recommend it for players from CS 1.6 OR CSS. Sure there are different mods, but people mostly play competitive and try to force their rank down your throat."

It would have been better to add a separate version of Counter-Strike: Danger Zone to the Steam Store and to make that version free to play, so that CSGO and its community are not affected in any form whatsoever."

Cheating:There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!2. DDOS-ing:I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!3. Smurfing:Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!4. Patches:Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!6. Community:The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.Over all:Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again!

1923,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. Every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them.Lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation i've ever felt in my life. It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working.I know it's weird but i'm telling you it feels incredible. I'm not saying other people should try it, but if you've got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water."
1924,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Good game unless trying out rank.Rank is full of either:1. Smurfs that never get any penelty for being a smurf 2.

1925,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive"

1927,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,Great game but filled with people cheating with hacks and valve has no intention of getting rid of them. They only ban a couple before they put the game on sale. Then you have the griefers that are saltier than a bag of layz chips with nothing but salt in it. And of course the odd times when bullets just will not connect with the head beacuse hitboxes are broken. My advice don't play this game.
1928,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Sounter-Strike: Global Offensive - a fresh look at Valve on how should look hardtuned discipline in the category ""team first-person shooter."" It is important to understand that CS: GO - it is not a ""continuation"" incorruptible CS 1.6 and not ""killer» Counter-Strike: Source. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive - a rethinking of many years of development experience, not afraid of the word, the best team shooters in the world"
1929,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"I played CS from 1.5 - started out when I was 12 or 13 I believe. Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again.There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen.Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis.Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team. I stopped playing mm for this reason now mostly 10mans and faceit."

1931,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"I deliberately did not wanted to review this game after few hours of playing, cause i wanted to wait out all patches and updates to come out...What to say about this game now after 667 hrs on record...best online FPS game for me!Fair successor of CS 1.6 & SourceStill has some flaws and isues regarding cheaters but it will be solved eventually...Buy this game its worth it!"
1932,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Well you're down here looking at reviews so either you're looking for a laugh, looking for someone who agrees with you, or are legitimately deaf to the social world and need this second opinion. If you're gonna read this just know this isn't written completely out of spite, it's just my way of rationalizing how such a decent game can cultivate one of the most horrifyingly sadistic and brutally toxic communities I have ever seen in my 18+ years of gaming.Well, here we go...If you value your time, self-esteem or general sanity, I advise you stay as far away from competitive as possible. Stop. Don't bother. Save yourself the heart condition and stick to casual. Or don't play at all, that would be the optimal choice. This game is a test of character, not just a test of skill, and I will tell you why.This game splits everyone into one of 3 categories of player, the one who is bad at playing but can learn and improve, the expert player who harrasses and belittles all others for not being good enough, and the trash players who votekicks and teamkills reguardless of target or skill. This, of course, is nothing new and is pretty common in all online multiplayer games. The harshness of this game, however startlingly eclipses all other communities I have ever seen, creating a sinkhole of reason and leaving everyone with pure hatred not only for the opposite team, but every single person on their own team.You see, like the snake that consumes it's tail, all players that stick with this game end up reaching the second archetype, who in turn become the harrassers after all the hostility they put up with. They go and become the average player in the game, maybe a youtuber, who baits others into trying the game and constantly filling the quota of targets to harrass and belittle. It's a self sustained cycle that has slowly ramped up since the game first came out in 2012, which I can attest as I have been here since the beginning (my hour count doesn't reflect this, so it doesn't relate).That's not to say this is a bad game, no no no. It's just that the entirety of the community is toxic and spiteful, with about 3/4 of them (a generous measurement I'm sure) that WILL sour the game for you. On the other hand if you somehow fit into this description, then by all means try your luck. I promise you your newly found anger management disorder will find a perfect home in your life.If you've made it this far you're either intrigued by what I've said thus far, or you are skipping to the end to see my point. Well either way here it is:If you really want to play this, whether it's for a friend or personal interest, stick to the casual and more open game modes, otherwise I guarantee that you will not like the outcome. Even if you do decide you like it, you will reach a point where you reassess what you've experienced, the community you've exp[osed yourself to, and eventually decide whether you want to put up with this anymore. It'll be your loss, but also your lesson."

I recommend the game but in a closed community."
1936,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"I have met all kind of adversaries, from noobs playing by the right arrows to professional ones.Valve has done an amazing job creating and developing the game, but at the same time they p1$$ed on all their work. I believe it's all business, and it's all for money.Many players are banned because they cheat and are forced to buy the game again.And people who don't cheat need to switch the matchmaking to Faceit, Esea, etc.VAC is extremely weak. Anybody can cheat!.I have reported cheaters on support.steampowered.com and no one replied. I bookmarked the steamid of the suspect players to see when they get Overwatch or VAC but aren't banned because they play 1 game a day so they won't get into the overwatch session and they can't get banned even when they play with ragebot. Reports on the profiles and tickets are useless. "
1937,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Yes yes and yes. Very fun! And one of my favourite games. It is very different from other games where you can just run around like a noob and expect to be the best player, this game is all about accuracy, tactics and team work which is great! There is always an intense feeling that I don't get from any other games!"
1938,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,If u want to waste money on this focking game then go for it-full of hackers-full of focking russians-some players wont talk at all-in this game are 8-10+ kids ho play this game(faggs) 
1939,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Not testing updates before implementing them since the start of the game, we had so many crashes and bug it's very sad to see such unprofessionalism. In a genre where customer satisfaction is key this game developers are showing a lack of skill that would get them fired at a serious software development company. Sad for long time customers."
1940,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO...CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me."
1941,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015," If I were to review this game seriously come out a scroll of words so I will limit myself to only some of them -C Y K A B L Y A T;-K U R W A;-CHEATER!-SMURF?-GL HF;-GG;-EZ;-REPORT!Love it, in its imperfections <3"
1942,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015," Don't play CSGO if you can't tolerate cheaters, racism, hatred amongst players (even your own teammates), and under average servers.  Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and ""var"", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.    However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.  "
1943,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a brilliant game, there is no doubt about it, defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today! However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any enjoyment out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state.Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and ""balanced matchmaking"" so that you always get a ""fair game regardless of your skills"", sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example.9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't touchy teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are vastly outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be impossible to do so if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire (which you will see a lot of), I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature almost every time. I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time and the veteran players aren't going to stick around forever, remember that. So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't.Another issue is that in the update cycle for this game, things often end up even more broken than repaired. As of right now there are some serious problems with frame rate drops and hit detection, which you probably imagine would take the highest priority on the developer to-do-list, but no. Skins, cases and all other forms of micro-transactions always take the highest priority. I appreciate that Valve is a business and that their goal is to make money, but nobody is going to stick around to play a broken game when they eventually get fed up of it like I and so many others have. We paid for this game and it is your duty to maintain it and make sure everything works like it's supposed to! On one final personal note, I really wish that there was some kind of option to disable skins in-game and maintain only the default models. They're bloody ugly and ruin the immersion, but this is only a personal gripe.The short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community and poor maintenance.Update: As of January 2017, I decided to try playing this game again to see if things have gotten any better. I'm afraid not, it's still in poor condition, hit detection is even worse and the community is still as toxic as ever. But hey, at least the cash-cow is still flowing in the forms of ""Glove Cases"" now, right? Sigh..."

Und jetzt ganz ruhig auf den Boden, klick auf LINK und geben mir deine CS:GO Skins... Viele Dank für Mitarbeit“Sie mögen keine lange Anleitungen und wissen nicht was Sie nun machen sollen.Dann wird es Zeit in die nettesten Gaming-Community einzutauchen die es gibt.Hab ich gesagt du kannst es kaufen, ich sagte du musst es kaufen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CS:GO ist wie eine gierige Frau, aber sie lieben sie für IMMER!Das Gefühl von Hass und Liebe vereint sich sie können nichts mehr daran ändere.Es ist wie Roulette ziemlich spaßig außer man spielt das Russische."

One of the current issues they have adjusted for the game is kicking players+leaving game are rolled into a negative effect. This should be 2 separate issues, If i kick someone for being an♥♥♥♥♥or going afk too many times and per that week I am already on a 2 hour ban from leaving a game I then recieve a 24 hour ban. So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open. So as this has gotten less and less the Community has begun promoting underage gambling websites to gamble your skins in hopes to getting better skins to make profit off of game. Which is disturbing when you connect to the game and you hear a 9 year old talk about his up's and down's with gambling his skins away....I would not recommend buying this game unless you intend on being a troll and can stand not getting agrravated by other trolls on this game."
1951,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive truly is a game like no other.In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you are tasked with globally offending as many people as you possibly can in 30 rounds, with an array of tools such as mic spam, teamkilling, or racist bullet messages. It differs from the original Counter-Strike (Known as '1.6' because there are 1.6 people still playing) in the fact that it's not 37 years old.Counter-Strike Hardline refines the tried and true formula of Police (Voiced by Nolan North) vs Counter-Police (Voiced by Troy Baker), bringing in many new faces to each team, such as Jewish Toad from Super Mario Bros, a black guy, a ghost with a beret, and a hot topic customer.Counter-Strike: Black Ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in, bringing the total amount of maps to 1, but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons, which I will now list for you.-Ak-47-M4-AWPAll in all, Counter-Strike: Global Defensive is a robust top down open world third person beat 'em up that tweaks the gunplay to its best, with amazing graphics and sound design, it's bound to keep you hooked until Counter-Strike 5.0/5"

1953,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Counter-Strike, you dear friend.. My first encounter with the series was in 2002 in the cyber coffees, maybe i was 4-5 years old at the time and we used to play CS 1.5 and Half-Life DM, fun times :). From 2002 to this date, i've been a loyal player of the Counter-Strike series. There is no other game that made me that much addicted for such a long time, believe me. Back in the day it was Counter-Strike 1.6, now it's CS:GO.Once i get into CS:GO, i can't quit. It's an extremely addictive game once you get into the competitive matchmaking and that's the worst thing, because i can't quit. I've been uninstalling it every week not because of rage-quits, but to prevent my self of playing it, then 4-5 days later i install it again. I love CS:GO, yet i hate it at the same time, because of my addiction problem with it. It's not CS:GO's fault that i am addicted to it, but this game is like the ciggarets - once you start smoking, you can barely quit them, and same goes for CS:GO, especially in the Competitive mode."

1955,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Matchmaking in this game is literally the most terrible thing i've ever stepped into. Just trying to rank up is literally impossible seeing the people that actually play this game either greif, hack, or flame. And it's pretty common to start a game with a useless bot because people don't know how to manage their time. It's about 1/5 chances you will be put in a good PUG and not only that, the game is infested with hackers. Every holiday the game goes on sale for basically pocket change and hackers just ruin the game. Good luck getting in a game with people who actually have common sense. "
1956,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Counter Strike - a huge franchise from Valve, I mean who hasn't heard of the countless streams, case openings and wizardrys all around this game, right? As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive.No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways.For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad. Considering this game has made it to ESL-Niveau, where even Teams, Tournaments, Global Matches and Prizes exist, having a pay-to-win aspect in it, is quite necessary nowadays. I do not mean to critisize anyone liking this, as I myself have had an inventory worth more than 10'000$ (by gambling), I definetely do understand the kick for all of this, but after all, as an old school gamer I'm asking you; Is this what gaming has envolved into? People getting CRAZY about chargeable SKINS that only aesthetically make a difference? You tell me.Anyways, enough of that crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ opinions are opinions, right?Controls are okay, graphics don't matter anyways, teamplay is strong, skill is required, what else to say? I think there are enough reviews about the actual game mechanics other than the critizised points listed above, so let me be your hero and skip that part. I haven't written reviews in a while, so let's end this one as it would fit into the CSGO Community.C yka ♥♥♥♥♥, I'll smoke mid, gg wp."
1957,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"So, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive... here we are.I have owned this game for over a year and haven't really started playing it until recently.My first impressions of the game were that aiming made completely no sense and that I couldn't understand what a single location call out meant period. I soon left CS GO to go back to other games I was playing at the time such as Dota 2 (another Valve game that has tons of hats) and H1Z1 (a game that has tons of hats because it wants to be like Valve).I recently came back to CS GO and have found a much deeper appreciation for it. While I did promise myself when I first got it that I wouldn't go crazy with buying skins, I recently did binge on getting a skin for every weapon. Most skins however were very cheap and I didn't dare attempt to go after a knife since I suck with sneaking up on people anyway.Now unto the actual review. Through practicing in Team Death Match, I've been learning how to use the weapons a lot more efficiently. I'm still nowhere near good but I do actually understand that tapping rather than spraying tends to result in a lot more people dying. When I'm more advanced at the game I'll begin to study how the spray patterns work in more detail so I'm not only tapping left click for all my shots but utilizing the spray more effectively as well.If you're playing the Casual game modes, I'd say it's fine to solo queue because it's quite laid back.For Competitive I tend to like to queue up with full lobby or with at least 1 other person. It makes it feel more fulfilling to either share in the victory or the defeat together.For anyone on the fence about this game or gave it up after not understanding why none of their bullets ever landed on their targets: This game might go on sale for $7.50 around Christmas time. For this price or even a price near that, it's a must have in my opinion. Don't spray at your targets when you're starting off. If you don't know spray patterns you'll just get destroyed and will barely be able to kill anyone. Always try to tap in an almost even rhythm if possible so your shots will be more accurate. Don't worry about winning or losing in the casual gamemodes(non-competitive). As far as I've realized so far, people may say things such as ""rekt"" or ""get owned"" but in the end your calibrated rank isn't being affected by these types of matches. Use new player friendly weapons when you're beginning such as the P90 when you're playing with friends that are more seasoned when they want to play actual games. When you are on your own or are doing death match rounds, use the trickier weapons such as the AK47 or AWP in situations where ultimately whatever happens people won't care about as much.I hope this was somewhat helpful. I'm still new but I have found a new love for this game. I'm pretty sure that once I start solo queuing in Competitive at some point that it'll be like Dota 2 where none of my team mates will speak English and things will be... interesting. Well with that said, I'm off to play some more CS GO!"

1960,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"I guess if you've got the money Valve has you can be as dumb as you want without backlash. Won't stop me from posting a snarky review about it though, guys just give up trying to make games if you're not gonna put resources and effort into it, it was funny at first but now it's just sad in my opinion.I'm sure the new game mode is just fine and they've got their reasons for making this free but they just used to be so much better than this, but I guess their vaults of gold were running low so we're left with this. Just stick with steam and making your hats and skins, you're going to make plenty of money either way."

Valve refuses to fix the problems that plague the game such as: -God awful anti-cheat (You get cheaters in almost every game at higher ranks.)-Terrible hit detection.-64 tick servers.-Terrible FPS with each update.-The report feature that does close to nothing.Valve doesn't care about anything but how many skins and gloves they can pump out for money.

1969,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another ""casual"" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment?Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.69/420"

I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more.I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE!

1980,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Deathmatch:- 2 teams (ct and t). aim is to run around and try get as many kills as you can.- different point values are awarded depending on the weapon used when you get a kill.- which ever player gets the most points will win the match for there whole team.- instant infinite respawn on death.- infinite ammo (but still have to reload).Competitive:- 2 teams (ct and t), aim is to complete an objective to win the round. which ever team is first to win 16 rounds wins the match. games can also end in a draw if both teams manage to get 15.- objectives, a round can be won by any of the following: 1. killing the whole enemy team (before the bomb is planted)2. killing the whole enemy team (before a hostage is rescued)3. defusing a planted bomb (ct win)4. bomb explodes (t win)5. by rescuing a hostage (ct win)- all players have a skill group ranging from unranked (lowest) to global elite (highest). players of a similar skill are placed together.- you cant leave the match, if you do you will get banned.Casual:- same as comp but any one can play with anyone else regardless of skill.- no ranking system- larger teams then comp.- leave or join match at any pointWar games:- a collection of game modes based off of comp or deathmatch but with diffrent objectives (e.g. win round by getting kill with knife in arms race) and different conditions (e.g. low gravity in flying scout's man).- the war games are as follows: arms race, demolition, and flying scoutsman.Battle Royale:- similar concept to PUBG or Fortnite. parachute in, large map, search around for weapons and loot.  to win, objective is to be last player alive.- servers are much smaller with only 16 players, which differs compared to the 100 players of other battle royale games like Fortnite.My opinion on new free to play update:why would any hacker waste money on buying csgo when they can play it for free?remember that non prime (free to play) and prime (paid users) dont mix.so by making the game f2p: it separates legitimate users (people who are willing to pay money for the game), with hackers (people would rather save them selves a bit of money and play the free version, as there is no need for them to waste money getting prime).so yes there will be a lot more hackers in free version, but you won't have to deal with them if you yourself are prime.in my opinion this is one of the best moves valve could of made. and i understand there thinking as to why they did it."
1981,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"One of the best games i played. I bought it, thought nothing of it. Played it again a month later and insantly got addicted, since then i've not came off it. 10/10 would buy again. 0/10 would buy a key again. :@  "

1983,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Since the dawn of time, I have lost hope in fps games and life itself generally because of milked franchises. The sky had no color, food had no flavor. After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man.  CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious.  This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages! For the casual players, you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive, you will def enjoy this. From the ""your mom"" 12yr old squeakers to the maturest people. This community is toxic as you'd expect, but from the smurf and hackers, you'll either quit or keep on trying."
1984,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"The 2 year and 2000hr summary; Pro – One of the most popular games on the steam networkCon – One of the most popular games on the steam networkPro – Immersive, complex and highly teamwork dependent game. Con – The lobby system, the matchmaking system and general practice of  “alternate accounts” really tends to crap all over the above mentioned pros. Pro – Allot of cool stuff available to buy, trade, sell! The trading and marketplace really brings a whole new perspective to gaming while teaching us valuable real world lessons.Con – With that being said, its almost impossible to not spend more money then the initial price. Getting tricked by scumbag traders, account hacked and your awesome stuff stolen are only the tip of cringe stories. Oh did I mention they are just skins with no function? :DConclusion: *smacks forehead* Look... The game is JUST OKAY. IT IS NOT the ultimate online pc shooter, but learning to play CAN BE TONS OF FUN with your friends. Hmm, whats this? Catch a little confidence? No worries!! Keep playing and the awesome CSGO community will be right there to rip it all to shreds and shove it back in your face. Cheers!That's all.. You may catch a few laughs outta the sh*** I wrote in the past down below, but with this summary my review is now complete. Peace out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competitive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your friends or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" against players who purchased a secondary account and posses the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competitive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, because you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These highly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smurfs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practically forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)-----Update 1------Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :DGood luck and (try to) have fun!----Update 2-----Thanks for all the responses everyone!The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :DI actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!"
1985,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"This is quite an enjoyable game. Driving through detailed environment is beautiful. As you progress through the game, you build up your truckers to work for your company, etc. It's a pretty deep experience."
1986,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"It's modern version of cs 1.6 and I think its more realistic with new design of skins, walls and everything. Its really good game to play with friends. Ranking and competitive game systems are most valuable things in Global offensive. There are achievements for achieve-hunters, arms race (typical gun-game) or demolition mode - so game has everything I wanted.CS:GO settings is changing all the time, but it will only anger you, so dont care about it just play! :DStill the best multiplayer FPS.8.5 /10Must love that gun. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCCimysCu1g "
1987,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"If only the devs cared about the game enough to do something about the rampant cheating problem, actually fixed issues with hitboxes and introduced 128 tick servers rather than adding new music kits and sprays. Money, money, money."

1989,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"The game itself : good.The community : the worst. Your teammates are actually your ennemies. And while the griefers, trolls and smurfs are annoying they can somehow be dealt with. The biggest problem is that the higher up the ranks you go, the bigger the egos get. Insecure manchildren then turn into full on bullies making solo queue unbearable to play. The only solution is to somehow make friends and play with the decent people, which requires planning, 4 people of your own rank with the same availability, and doesn't then allow you to play ""casually"" in competitive mode."
1990,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"UPDATE 18/02/2017: New insight on the game. You can read my old review below.Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck.Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming.They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>.What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished.And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick.So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed.This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it.Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules.VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either. Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again.The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended.tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once."
1991,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"i have played counter strike since beta which has been pretty much since online gaming has been around. This is a great game that is super fun, but with the cheaters that have been flooding the servers it is impossible to have a good time... I if want to cheat and own people trying to just have a good time on there free time then this is the game for you... otherwise find something else to invest your time into, maybe a single player game..."
1992,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"I used to like this game alot... i played 600 hours in like a year which is alot for me. and as of the day i wrote this review, this  became my least favorite game... its filled with hackers in competive matchmaking. i cant even play one competitve match without getting a hacker. bad choice on the devs for making it f2p."
1993,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"So long, my good friend, so long... I will miss you terribly.Before I begin, allow me to say that I reached GNM from GN2 in one week and I was playing with MG1 players until my last game.After a couple of years playing, I have no other choice but to hang my AK and M4 on the wall, and unistall this game that entertained me like few ever did, while not recommending it to anyone at the same time.Why is that, you may ask? Allow me to keep you busy for some of your precious time to elaborate.Until a few years ago, this game was one of the best tactical FPS you would find out there. It was fun, rewarding, and filled the gap between casual gamers and gamers that where seeking a bigger challenge. Of course, there where the usual trolls, hackers, smurfs, flamers, but they where merely the minority. Most teammates where good people to play with and made you enjoy your time spent bombing or defending sites.And this year, 2016, not only many celebrities died, but also the fun this game once offered.Now, it's impossible to play competitive without a team of friends you know that can play well. And for a player like me, that enjoys a little bit of solitude now and then and testing his own powers alone by going solo, that means one thing: Either play always with others, or lose everything you worked for.Playing with others is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I already explained why I enjoy some alone time every now and then though. But playing with others means I don't get to play when I want, or reschedule other games and free times for the sake of competitive.It turns into something like a job, full of schedules, stress, pressure and complete lack of amusement.To top it off, the game's players can be expressed in these categories:Casuals: your usual, run-of-the-mill players that team up with a friend or two, or they even may go alone.Premades: Most CSGO players are going in as teams. But, if you are unlucky and bump to a 4 man premade team, you are screwed in most times. Your every mistake will be exploited and become a reason for your team to flame you hard, or even kick you. Very rarely premades will make you feel like an actual part of the team (and these players are worth adding to your friend list).Smurfs: I like to call them the best players the Bane of Global Offensive. Smurfs ruined this game more than anyone. Being assigned against/with players that are, in reality, way high above your skill means you don't get to improve, you won't make any progress in rising through the ranks, and if you play against them, it's almost certain you have already lost.Then you have cheaters that can take on entire hordes of you and your teammates alone. More fun lost.Overwatch is not doing much to punish cheaters and despite VAC, people still cheat with, you guessed it right, smurf accountsIn other words, it's pointless to try playing competitive with the player base being such a fake one this period.Hence, I quit until one day I hear this game is getting back on the right track with fewer smurfs and cheaters. And I strongly recommend not to buy it, or at least stay as far away from competitive as possible.SPOILER ALERT: never open cases, sell them insteadRATING:Gameplay: 8/10 (non-competitive) 3/10 (competitive)Presentation: 8/10Enjoyment (replacing story): 7/10 (non-competitive) 2/10(competitive)Unique Factor: Community: 3.5/10OVERALL: 6.6/10 (non-competitive) 4.1/10 (competitive)Someone get me a match and some alcohol.

You rely in your teammates more than you would think and communication is key. I would buy this game if you like teamwork and you like games that require skill to play. Or you can just buy a p90, rush, and enjoy silver rank."
1996,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Don't buy this game if you are a casual gamer that does not enjoy spending money on virtual gun skins and boxes of pure misery.Well i do enjoy this kind of games, so i guess i've already blown off quite a bit of money on it already, and more is to be dropped into Gabe's wallet. If you play in Europe, there is a big chance that you will be queued up with russians. they tend to only speak russian to you, and nothing else which is kind of annoying.I do find the game itself quite entertaining and frustrating at the same time, but i do reccomend it if you are into 1st person shooters where the hackers are almost non-existant.i r8 8/8 [EDIT] Reaching legendary eagle you start to notice hackers every few matches.."
1997,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"This game is probably the best game i've purchased on steam. I mainly play this game competetively, so if you dont like games that get harder and require practice to eventually be really good at, i would'nt think that you'd love this game. But I am not saying that this is a bad game by any means, i have tons of friends that never play competetive but still love the game. This game is also fun to play with friends on community servers to play common things like surf, mini games, or jailbreak. Even if you dont like the competetive aspect of the game you should still buy it and try it out considering that its only 15 dollars! Another thing that makes this game great is the economy; i've probably made about $25 dollars off the game so far, but also given back about $30 dollars from gun camo's, DLC, and cases, etc... If you have an extra $15 to spend i tottaly recommend this game, but you never know, you might just end up with about +500 hours in the game like me."
1998,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"Honest Review----Skins:        Ok you have a case now pay some money for a key... Okay now you won a weapon with some value YAY you are never going to sell because the colors are pretty. So in result you're just an idiot spending money on colors for a gun. You are too special for the regular skins?----Competitive:          All you will expirence is rage towards your teammates because they don't do the thing you expect them to do. Or people will insult you with a mic because you're a noob even if it's round 1 and no shooing began. Or you can compare with your friend your rank saying hey I am in AK Gold I don't have any skills I just play a lot and insult people.----Game itself:         If you play none Competitive mod all you will find is either the casual mod which is good but filled with players who filled with rage because they are disapointed of their ranks on Competitive so you will end up leaving. The only good part of Counter Strike Globale Offensive is the mods like Jailbreak, deathrun, surf. But most people don't play on it because they play those awesome mods on CSS the real thing.----Opinion:Great game, but sadly money and popularity caught up. And now people don't play the game like they use to. It's all about competitive and weapon skins which is depressing. And now I saw they added a kill cam? I am sorry to say but this game died 1 year ago. If you're interested to play competitive and spend all you money on useless skins be my guest.Even if playing Competitive is all about raging towards your teammates or simple rage because you think your good but you're not. If you got taste in video game, then buy counter strike source. I am sorry but if this is a good game for you, you are not better than League of Legends players and not gamers.FYI there is no true challenge raising in ranks in CS:GO it's all about playing a lot no skills is needed. Counter strike Source is what i recomand no this. This is just a shadow of Counter Strike Source."
1999,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Its a great game so i had to nominate it for awards. CS:GO is a game with good graphics when it's played on maximum settings for graphics. The game has many maps to play (Active and Reserve pool) and they all look great by texture. Ofc, there will be maps you like and dislike but that's normal. CS:GO is a game that is compatible with any Operating System on ur computer/notebook, you can play this game on any system (notebook/macbook/imac/computer because it doesn't require great specs to be playable. The Character models and weapons texture can maybe be improved, especially the character models. More variouty would do a great work in my opinion, but some people of course do love the game as it is. The weapon skins and items variouty is amazing in this game, you have many options for every weapon. Everyone is able to find something to his/her personal taste which is a great thing. Also every now and then there is an operation, which gives you a nice badge, more maps to play (u will lose them after the operation ended) but meanwhile the operation u can play anytime on those maps which all look great. I want to thank a big part of the community for making amazing stuff in this game. Personally I would rate this game a 9/10 and it's my favorite by far. The only reason I don't rate it 10/10 is because many people are so toxic in this game, but to make them shush is just block communication. Many people want to win, and when they lose they become toxic, but sometimes you just can't win because there is always someone better then you!+ points : no lagg. good graphics. nice weapon skins. great maps, good workshops, customizeable in some ways to maximum ur performance.- points : many toxic players, so the only down point is some people of the community, especially Russians"

Casual can be sometimes painful coz from time to time you will run into few toxic players but stil can be fun.If you play ranked (competetive) matches and lets say again you are at least above average player you could be top player almost in every match (ofcorse lets hope u don't run into cheater or some skilled player on smurf account) and you would gain ranks relativly easy ofcorse higher rank = higher skill group so more chance to meet your skill level people or better then you (remeber there always someone better, nobody is godlike).If you want to gain fast XP for account rank best way is to play ranked matches.This game is INFESTED with cheaters, not playable anymore, time to make LONG LONG pause.New additional info: Game is updated FPS diference is like 100fps now it warries from 120fps - 290fps it's idiotic and just to mention new sounds ingame are also idioticStil no improvements only more and more disapointment, sadly.GL & HF :)"

After hours of play its still like a new game and met some of the best people on it.  One of the most challenging and competitive FPS as well. It challenges your mind, as well as your aim. When playing competitive you can finally play against people that that share your skill, contrary to source and 1.6. This game plays as well as source and 1.6, if not better. CS:GO is the best game ever"
2004,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,This game is very wierd but cool. I know no other FPS that plays like this. Skill is very needed to be good at this game. The weapon skins thing is very cool. especially the fact that yoo can sell your items too. Its not like COD where you get ripped off for some character crap and some stupid weapons for 300$. Alteast on here you could make profit or look very fancy with your skins. Keep up the good work. Also thanks for making the anti hacker system way better with the overwatch thing. But one thing i dont agree with is the banning system. I shouldnt have to wait a month to play if i accidentally hit a noscope with an AWP across the map. Please update that and ill be a happy weebee boy :)
2005,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,I play CS:GO since Januar 2014 and it's one of the best Counter Strike's made. I played nearly 5 years CS:S and it was hard to get into the new CS but its worth. Pretty good game :)
2006,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"I am one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'veterans', who started playing with counter strike 1.6 (didn't have my own account by those time, though) and I have long story of 'relationship' with counter strike universe and csgo universe especially. Telling in advance - I made long way from hating csgo up to loving it. But anyway, to the point:For people, who don't know what counter strike is, and who never heard about this game before:Counter strike is unique semi-reallistic game, which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups (somali pirates, phoenix connection, etc) and different law enforcement groups (SAS, GIGN, GSG-9, SWAT, FBI etc). Game features several rounds (from 16 up to 32, depends on a gamemode and server rules), where every player have only one life per round. As soon as round time ends, or one of the teams eliminated, round is finished. After every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets (armor, flash and smoke grenades, etc). Game features several game modes:(classic) hostage rescue (maps with ct_prefix):Counter Terrorists must steal hostage (or any of the several hostages) from a place, secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone. As soon as hostage is brought, or whole terrorist team eliminated, counter terrorists win. If time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area, terrorists win. As soon as counter terrorist carries hostage, whone CT team gets extra 1:30 minute time to reach safe place.(classic) bomb defuse (maps with de_prefix):Terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants. Problem is, there's only one bomb per whole team. As soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead, another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point. Counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place, if it's fallen. As soon as bomb is planted, round time stops and to win, counter terrorists must defuse bomb. If bomb is blown, even though all terrorists are dead, terrorist team wins the round.gungame (Honestly, forgive me if I make mistake here, but it's one of the gametypes I barely played): The least teamplay addicted game type. You start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone, you get new weapon. As soon as you come through all the weapons (including knife), you win the map. You instantly respawn after death. I remember there was also gungame gametype, where you had only one life, but gungame is not my cup of tea, so let's finish on this.deathmatch:Also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death. But, unlike gungame, you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life. You should kill as many enemies, as you can. Thanks to respawn in random places of the map, fight itself reminds a messy war, where enemy can shoot you in the back (just because he respawned there) and so on. I don't normally play this gametype aswell, but if I remember right, this gametype was brought by community.Also, community made more gametypes, like zombiemod, bunnyhop (or whatever is it called) and deathrun, where you need to reach some point.Now, for people who played cs for a while. Main differences from cs 1.6 and css here are: partially new weapons, updated radio commands, updated hostage rescue mode, where you need to actually PICK UP only ONE hostage and bring him to the safe place. Weapons have changed physics, so you'll need to learn everything again. And, an old problem, which became more important duo to competative gamemode: CHEATERS! Can't say there are many cheaters, but when you meet them, whole fun is ruined. Same when you meet stupid people.As we reviewed the game (I tried to be as short as possible), I'll express my mind on it:Firstly, I hated this game. It seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy. It had (and it still has) changed radio commands (yes, I was one of those few people, who used radio commands), you couldn't (and still can't) choose your player model (only team, like in css beta), you had and (still have) some grenades, which, probably don't even exist (decoy and incendinary, the molotov analogue, btw molotov here bounces from the wall, wtf?), or at least I was unable to find any info about them. In hostage rescue mode, why would you need to save only ONE hostage? Why would cops leave another one behind? You couldn't place silencer on M4 and 'base ct pistol', or use flashlight and many more things which I couldn't remeber right now. With time, Valve fixed their gaps, and I came to some re-analysis of the situation:First of all let's all agree with the fact, that cs:go is, unlike css, a complete SEQUEL of an online game, so OF COURSE it should have some differences, like radio commands, weapon reballance and stuff More over, with time it turns out, you don't need to hit your enemy 10 times, it's just you moving, so THAT'S WHY you don't hit the enemy. The ballance itself is still the same: 1-6 shots, depends on what weapons do you use; Indeed, you can't use player model, but they made 5 different models for each side, so you'll have no more 3 twins, out of 5 people playing, which, actually, compensates your choice of the model. Some changes were made for the sake of ballance (talking of hostages and some weapons' accuracy) Grenades... Well, firstly, I can't say these grenades are something sci-fi like. I believe that even if they don't exist, humanity can create them, using our own technologies. Also, Valve made special inventory, where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons, so now, you can use old good m4a1 with silencer, just as you did in css and cs 1.6, among with USP and it's silencer and another new pistol for exchange. They also made different skins for all weapons, so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color (though, imo, it's a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players' weapons, just because they love colorful schemes). Talking about radio commands again, it's better using VOIP instead of them, so updating radio is not a big deal...And now, I'd say, the best part of cs:go - it's competative mode. Competative mode features only classic gamemodes. In competative mode you play 5vs5. The more wins you get, the higher your rank is, the higher your rank is, the harder opponents and better allies are met. Competative mode is where whole TACTICAL potential of a game is shown. There's no map with perfect spot, enemy can always attack from the side, so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other, or rush same place from different directions, to capture it, with no any losses. Here's where all weapons are needed: short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner, long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range. Though medium range weapons are the most often used, I must admit. You can play in a party with your friends, but be ready, because game will give you more cooperated team. Of course, not everything is perfect - sometimes game gives you wrong ranks, or you meet always-raging-idiot, or, what is worse, cheater, who kills you through the wall, but all in all it's a good game. A good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths. What else can I say? If you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike, or you are thinking of buying it or not, my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game. It's just the game you should 'understand'. Too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games."
2007,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"This is my Review on Counter Strike: Global Offence:Pros:- Great game if your willing to sit down for up to 90 minutes and have an even skill matched game.- Will run well on most Computers- Fast matchmaking when searching for a game- Great if you have a group of friends to play with- Provides many Hours of EntertainmentCons: - Many Pre-Pubesent children in games that make it hard to enjoy Deathmatch/Casual- Try-hard players in most games who will flame you if you let the team down, even in the slightest way- ""Smurf"" players in most low rank competitive games, they side the whole match to the team that they're on, which leads to a very boring and frustraighting competitive game.- Hackers in many games, most of the time they get dealt with quickly, but some slip through.- Easily get banned from competitive matchmaking for stupid reasons, for example i recently recieved a 24 hour ban for voting yes to kick an AFK player on my team.It does seem like the cons are overwelming, but this is from my experience. I have also had allot of fun and met lots of great people, try it out yourself and see what you think. Personally i think it is worth the $10 USD, thanks for reading, sorry for the spelling errors and the incorrect grammar."

2010,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games i just wanna play all the time. This game is really good. The graphics are good, the gameplay are fun and the game modes are fantastic. I have been spending so much time on this wonderful game mode Competitive. Competitive is a mode where two teams are fighting against each other and the first team that wins 16 rounds win the match. You can play this game with your friends, you can play this game with yourself and you can play this game with strangers. I really don't get tired of this game, it keeps my mood up and if i don't know what to play i start CS:GO. If you don't already own this game you should be a shame because this is a MUST own. All in all you won't regret that you bought this game if you like FPS games, the CS series and games made by Valve. And here comes the best thing - Skins. You can buy several skins for your favorite guns. There is alot of skins + You get drops every week. These skins can be bought from the Community Market!Another review by Niko Bellic!

2012,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"If you are an OSX user, this may not be for you. Continuous and spontaneous crashes and other issues (including your aim being locked and you are dropped to 20fps) ruin the competitive experience. The random crashes don't seem to be as common for PC users for whatever reason. Recent updates to the Matchmaking system have now caused lower-ranked players (Silver and Gold Nova) to be continually matched with players with considerably more skill and experience, known as ""Smurfs"" to the community. While these ranking tweaks had good intentions, especially for highly-ranked players (Global Elite, SMFC etc.), they just seemed to amplify the smurfing problem to  a much greater extent. Smurfing ruins the competitive scene, especially for beginners and lower ranked players who have not yet been able to grow and learn to the extent of the experienced 'Smurfs'. While some may acclaim that Smurfing allows players to improve, by playing against players of greater skill, when you lose a gun battle to a smurf, round after round, you're forced to sit and spectate while you wait for the next round to begin. If you are most interested in watching the game instead of being able to play it, watching Professional CSGO tournaments might be your speed. It makes it hard to improve at the game when you are pummeled by a Smurf game after game, day after day.Besides this all, the millions of daily players cannot be wrong. Gameplay is fluent and heavily based on cooperation with teammates. CSGO gives a motivation to improve, to climb the Matchmaking ranks and become the best player you can be. Even the weapon skins add  a huge element to the game that is purely about a virtual economy for aesthetic customisations in-game.CSGO is an immersive experience, and is a great game to play with friends - a game to learn together and grow together to top the ranks of Competitive Matchmaking. However, every game has its flaws. Crashes, gameplay issues and smurfing are amongst the most heinous (and I haven't even touched on the cheaters). Overall, 400 hours of regular playtime speaks for itself, but major issues need to be addressed so that the game becomes more enjoyable for everyone, becomes a more competitive experience and the community can grow together in appreciation of the game."

2016,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"CSGO has gone free to play, without compensating those who had purchased the game.Worst of all, they have added a flimsy battle royale mode that will be dead in a few weeks.'Smart' choices all around.

Valve wake up!! everyone hate this game because the cheaters here!!"
2019,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Soooo... this game is now free to play. Used to be priced at $15. I suppose it was because of Artifact being a complete disaster. But it would all be a contradiction in that case. Long story short, game developers no longer know what they're doing. First a battle royale mode, and now this...?What actually costs money is thePrime Edition, which pretty much gives you preference in terms of matchmaking. Which means you'll most likely face other players who bought the game more often.The main problem being that, as it is now a F2P game, hackers won't need to pay up to cheat. If they're banned, they can just make another account. Now, to the actual review.The game is good overall. Mostly based on you using your sight and your hearing to locate enemies. And also controlling your weapon's recoil.Although your weapon may seem normal in your screen, the bullet pattern will certainly not be normal, especially if you're used to spray and pray.Of course, there will be moments of tension where aiming a centimeter lower may get you a kill, or get you killed.Toxicity levels aren't high, but they're not low either. It's what you can expect from a game with a competitive scene nowadays. As you no longer need to pay to play it, installing it is up to you.One thing I'll mention though: just tap fire with the AK-47. And if you're using the AWP, you may want to save the ''honor of using a Sniper rifle to headshot people, because that's why the rifle has a scope on it''.Oh, yeah, and RIP everyone (me included) who paid for the game."
2020,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"CSGO relies heavily on teamwork. Whilst this game's mechanics are extremely well done and fun to learn, the idea of forcing players to work as a team is it's major downfall.Unless you have 4 other friends to play with, more often than not you're going to be matched with trolls, griefers and/or bad players, which becomes extremely frustrating.Other than that, goes on sale all of the time and is a lot of fun. If you have the friends or think you can meet some whilst playing then I really can't reccomend it enough.Nothing beats the tension of this game."
2021,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"It's Counter-Strike. This game hasn't changed too much from the original MOD. It's still the #1 (as of writing) competitive FPS game. Not even Overwatch, CoD or Quake can compete.Don't like competitive? Don't worry, there are other modes too, not to mention community servers with custom game modes from 1v1 arenas, to surfing to bunnyhopping challenges.Yes the community has toxic members, but what popular online game doesn't? Mute and report them and move on with your life.If you like FPS games, I strongly recommend this game. It will take some time to ""get good"" but with enough practice and some YouTube tutorials ever now and then, you'll enjoy getting better at this game."
2022,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"""2 days ago, December 7, 2018, a date which will live...in gamer infamy. the veteran CSGO community, was violently and deliberately attacked, by instincts and greed, of the Empire of Valve. The Valve community was at peace with this once great nation, and at the solicitation of Valve, the promise of the introduction of Half-Life 3 and the promise for a great, prosperous community. Indeed, 9 days after the release of Artifact, the game's reception has received Mixed reviews and a score of 77% by Metacritic. The game had lost half of it's playerbase within a week and the numbers were plunging consecutively. While this playerbase criticism was still on the rise within the ""Artifact"" community, Valve did not give out a direct response.It will be recorded that the Battle Royale trend and Valve's indirect cohesion within it's community makes it obvious that the trend continues to fuel our Lord and Savior ""Gaben"" with greed and instinct. This trend may have been planned for weeks or even months. During the intervening time, Valve Software has deceived us with the hopes of giving the things we desire most from our Lord and Savior, with the abandonment of the Half Life campaign and it's writers.The trend 2 days ago has been widely received as negative and ""F2P"" and a deliberate ""waste of money"" to CSGO community. A that day, they have given us the pointless ""Prime Status"" to ""Honor"" those who have played for thousands of hours. Clearly, it was an indirect apology made by developers themselves.Valve, has undertaken a deceitful advantage over it's playerbase extending throughout Steam. The facts from 2 days ago and the days to come speak for themselves. The People of Steam have formed have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the trends and cringe that will affect our great community.As a common speaker of the CSGO community, I have suggested to prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the upcoming 9 year old invasion and prepare all global elites to take any direct measures to fight back against the coming horde. But always will the Valve community remember the deceitful lies our lord has brought us.""DISCLAIMER: I made this as a joke review because I thought it be creative as hell. This is also to commemorate for the fallen of the Pearl Harbor attack planned by the Empire of Japan, I give credit to FDR for creating the original and thought provoking speech for Congress and the people of the United States. However, I still give this a negative review because I don't agree with valve's instincts of making a BR gamemode to attract a community of children to play this game and the Free to Play option.

2037,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2013,"The CS:GO community has grown since it was first released a few years ago, but that doesn't mean it has gotten better. The community has inevitably grown to something much more than it was originally intended to be. What do I mean by this? Well I'll point that out.1. The number of hackers/cheaters has only gotten bigger over the years and Valve isn't doing anything about it, unfortunately. Yes, the VAC system works, but there are some cheats out there that are undetectable, an example such as LMAO Box (which is also heavily in TF2). Valve doesn't care about their own community in terms of cheaters/hackers, but they can fix this, by improving the security of their ""reliable"" anti-cheat system. 2. The community is full of trolls and jerks. There will always be at least one or two trolls within a server trhat you currently play in. There always be someone screaming over the mic, cursing out other people, and overall being more or less of a big annoyance. There's nothing you can do about either, you can't mute the person within the game, you have to deal with it or you have to mute your sound or leave to go to another server, which defeats the whole purpose in getting a higher rank. You can also decide to have a poll to have the user kicked off, but this never works. They will always attempt to vote you off if you are caught voting the targeted user off. It's also really annoying when someone voted to reset the server match over 50 times because they died and everyone votes to reset the match. No one cares for other people's enjoyment, they only care about themselves. 3. The economy in this game is demanding. There will always be people asking for things, such as knives, weapon sking and stickers. The first time I heard trading was introduced in this game, I knew it was going to stir trouble. Like TF2, people trade for greed and wealth, not for playing the game for fun. Speaking of which, your always made fun of if you don't have a skin attached to a weapon, not everyone wants those things you know! CS:GO is turning into TF2, Overwatch and COD all at the same time. The community has only gotten worse over the years and Valve isn't doing anything to improve/fix this. I don't want to think of this as another TF2, but unfortunately, that is what it has become and it will likely always be that from now on, because Valve wants all their games to be similar in terms of their other multiplayer games."

Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy??"
2039,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Valve finally broke the game for good. Hackers here and hackers there! Hackers everywhere. I can't see any legit gamer staying with the game, unless Valve fixes the anti-cheat (which they won't). Disappointing to say the least. Rip CS 1999-2018."
2040,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is such a strange time in a young person's life.Don't ask Counter-Strike: Global Offensive why I'm writing this right now. It's late at night and the events of that day seem like they happened so long ago. Yet, I can't get them out of my head right now. Maybe it's just my nerves. Maybe it's the darkness outside. I don't really care, honestly, but I need to get this off my chest. Otherwise, I might not be able to sleep tonight. Damn these memories, I wish they would just go away.It was about eleven years ago when I was in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I was in the seventh grade and I was that kid who wore all black and listened to heavy metal in the back of the classroom. Yeah, I was a goth kid. It seems silly to think about now, but everyone had their own little click when they were in LAN parties, I suppose. The goth scene really appealed to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a kid. I was bullied a lot, even before I decided to wear all black and listen to heavy metal full blast on my walkman. The '♥♥♥♥ everyone else in the world' mantra really suited Counter-Strike: Global Offensive at the time. And, for three of my 'CSGO Buddies', it suited them as well. I guess that's why we got along so well.My CSGO Buddies, two of which I haven't heard from for several years now, were just like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They were goths too. Everyone back then had a clique, I suppose. They were mine. We would spend every waking moment together, both out and in of LAN parties. They were like my strange, outcast family. Well... at least they were. Times change. I still remember their faces clearly. There was Andy, a very tall, robust kid that was the oldest out of all of us. Kyle, my best CSGO Buddy, who was short and very thin. While his frame may have been small, he got into fights -a lot-. He had a fuse the size of a bacterium, and wasn't afraid to give someone he didn't like a black eye. Then there was Billy. Billy was bullied the hardest out of all of us. Braces, pimples, and thick-framed glasses made him the perfect target for bullying. Yet, we four didn't care about anyone else when we were hanging out together. The rest of the world didn't matter; only the next Slipknot album did.I'm rambling aren't I?Well, perhaps I should get to the meat of things then. Where this horrible memory comes from and why I never see those old CSGO Buddies anymore.My CSGO Buddies and I would always go to a park after LAN parties and on weekends to hangout. This park was massive and held a Counter-Strike diamond, a football field, and a soccer field for all of the little kids and their little league games. However, at the edge of this park, was a large wooded area. It was completely cut off from the rest of the park and community. That was where my CSGO Buddies and I would go to hang out. There, no one would see us or bother us. It was the perfect solitude for a couple of goth kids. The strangest thing about this little wooded area, however, was a large, out of place wall that seemed to edge to park. I found out later that the wall was meant to sepaCounter-Strike: Global Offensivee an old World War II factory from the park so that the kids wouldn't have to be reminded of the war, but to a couple of kids growing up in the early 2000's, it was an eerie landmark.The strangest part about the wall... aside from the terrible graffiti, was the seemingly out of place door right in the middle of the wall. The door was completely rusted over and had long lost its handle. The door was more or less part of the stone wall, at this point. I'm not really sure how it was able to stay standing after so many years of disrepair. It was definitely a testament to its forger.Now, I know that this must sound pretty cliché. Yet, I'm sure that whoever is reading this must be pretty curious as to what is behind that door. Well, as fate would have it, it turns out that four goth kids with nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon were also extremely curious as to what was behind that door.That Saturday afternoon, at about four p.m. or so... after the little league Counter-Strike game, I met up with my three bozo CSGO Buddies right by the door, since it was where we usually met. The three had obvious mischievous smiles plastered all over their faces.""Oh, what are you guys planning on doing?"" I asked accusingly, but a smile also stretching over my lips as I looked the three over. Andy grinned devilishly as he picked up a steel Karambit Knife from the tall grass. My eyes widened and my smile widened.""We're opening that door, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I stole this Karambit Knife from my old man's work truck. He's got, like, three of them. He won't even know it's gone."" Andy said laughing a bit. I remember becoming extremely giddy, almost attaining five year old levels of excitement.""Well? What the hell are you waiting for?! Open the door!"" I shouted at him. The other two began encouraging him as well. With a smug look, he placed the Karambit Knife at the frame of the door and began pushing on it. Now, Andy was a big kid and the door was extremely worn down. It didn't take much effort for him to open the door. With a loud crack, the door flung open, and the four of us, dumbstruck, looked into what was behind the door.It was a staircase going down into an incredibly dark basement... or bunker... or something. We couldn't even see the bottom of the stairs because of how dark it was. For about five minutes, we just stared down the concrete stairs in awe. Kyle was the first one to break the silence.""Whoa..."" he spoke, ""It goes down awhile, doesn't it?""""Yeah,"" Billy said, swallowing a bit. ""W-We should go though. Someone must have heard us. We gotta go before they call the cops.""""Oh, don't be such a baby. We've gone this far, we gotta go down the stairs!"" Andy exclaimed. The three of us looked at Andy with worried looks. We may have been goth kids, but we were still kids.""I don't know, Andy. It's pretty dark, and we don't have a flashlight."" Billy said.""Pfft, alright wuss. Go on, Kyle, you go down the stairs.""""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why the ♥♥♥♥ Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? You're the one who opened the door! You go down the stairs!"" He spat angrily. Andy furrowed his brow.""Yeah, and without my Karambit Knife, that door would still be closed, wouldn't it? I already get a free pass on this. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you got here last, you gotta go down the stairs!"" he yelled at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. My eyes widened as my attention turned from the stairs to the three others.""What? Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why? It wasn't even my idea to open the door! I'm not going down there!"" I said, worried.""Come on! Someone's gotta go down. Billy and Kyle are too big of cowards to do it. That leaves you.""""I'm NOT going down there.""""Oh? I can't make you?""""You can't force Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to do it.""""Oh really?""BAM!I felt the large, blunt force of a heavy hand against the back of my head as Andy sucker-punched Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Andy was bigger and, well, let's just say broader than all three of us put together. His punch nearly knocked Counter-Strike: Global Offensive out. In my daze, I remember hearing Kyle shout something as Andy placed his hands on my shoulder and shoved Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I didn't hit the ground like I thought I would. Instead, I just remember falling. Falling down and down into an unfathomable abyss of darkness. He pushed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive down the stairs, but being as light as I was, I never even hit a single concrete step. I just fell, and fell, and fell until I hit the bottom. I hit the concrete floor hard. The impact knocked the wind out of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but, surprisingly, I didn't break any bones or, well, die. The world span and I couldn't even get up, let alone speak."

2048,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014," I don't speak English really well, so try to understand what is implied.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review Counter-Strike is a series of multiplayer FPS games, where two teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, battle for a specific mission. The game was initially a mod for Half-Life, Valve's first game, until the sequels of the game were created some time later.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the latest game of the series, and today it is the most-popular competitive FPS game ever played. The game is just basically the same as the first Counter-Strike games, but a ton of additions and improvements were done.  Graphics First, the graphics. This is probably the biggest improvement in the series, as the game now looks more pleasing to the eyes, it has smooth movements throughout the game, and there has been a lot of decal improvements. Compared to the earlier games, Global Offensive provides a better and player-friendly nature thanks of today's modern graphics.Of course all of these cannot be achieved if you don't have the requirements to play on a flawless gameplay, but it is believed that it can run even on entry-level PC's.  Gameplay Gameplay. As I have said before, Global Offensive is mostly the same as the earlier games, consisting of the two game modes Bomb Scenario, wherein Terrorists must plant a bomb to a bomb site in a map and the Counter-Terrorists must defend or defuse the bomb if planted, and Hostage Scenario, wherein Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages held by Terrorists.Though there are additionals game modes that can be played. These modes are the Arms Race, Demolition, and Deathmatch. (although I believe these modes can be played on the previous games through a mod)Global Offensive also made changes to the gun system, they have added more guns to the shop and made improvements to them.The sound is still the same as the previous ones, however, around this year they have made changes to the guns' sounds, But the sound from Global Offensive is a lot better and clear than the others. Community The community is what most Valve games' community have. There isn't really much to say here, although it's worth mentioning that the community on this game series is actually more friendly and cooperative than other Valve's games. And since this a competitive game, (I'd say highly competitive), a lot of players are pretty serious on playing since this involves a huge amount of cooperation with the team.Toxicity is somewhat not that visible to the game, so players who are really serious about competitive games are present. Miscellaneous Like DOTA 2 and Team Fortress 2, Valve's other popular games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has also what they call the inventory system. Here you can get item drops such as gun skins, gun stickers, and cases where you can get the gun skins and stickers. These items can be used to customize your gun loadout, or sell them to the Steam Market, where you can get money from. (If you are lucky, there are rare items which have high price on the market listings where you can sell those rare items for $$$.) Final Notes Overall, this game is one of the best games out there, for a cheap price, and offers a lot of opportunities to choose how you want to play the game. You could try making yourself into the game and go for the rankings, play casually to pass time, or probably to troll just to relieve stress and have fun for yourself. There is a lot of space for you to improve in the game, but still, like most multiplayer game does, playing this game with friends give the best possible experience and gameplay for the game.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not a pay-to-win game, and if you wanted to spend money on this game, make sure you just make it worth the money you spend on the game.-----------Definitely get this game if you want to get started on competitive gaming, or if you're just looking for a game that is worth the time and money spending. In fact, the most annoying and irritating things that could occur in the game is actually the most hilarious and most fun to deal with.Counter-Strike is a really popular game, so why not just get the game, and shoot down other players and join the fun?"
2049,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2014,Ok i change my mide CS:GO is one of the bast FPS game i have every play but there still the macth makeing thing that place you in a game with batter ppl that the only con i found.Othere there that the game play is good how the gun fire is good. the only thing that is sad is that if you do bad for a round everyone call you a Nood and if you do good in a round and you kill i lot of player on the other team thay we star calling you a hack . So good luck and have fun and CSGO
2050,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"Valve To be honest.Before you release the new rule,I think you should get us known.In this situation,i think set the 7days to 1day freeze that’s truly benefit to the real players I hope u can see this"
2051,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"I used to like counter strike global offensive a great deal, even though there was a hacker problem. Now that the game is free, I cannot join a single public game that wouldn't have hackers openly admitting hacking and spamming their hacks in chat. I'd recommend everyone to stay away from this, unless they somehow fix the hacker problem, which I doubt they will now that it's free and bans don't mean anything. I'll miss you cs:go"
2052,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"I tried getting into it but most the time, instead of helping you learn, the teams just kinda hate on you for messing up and are sometimes a bit kick happy. The surfs and hackers are also a little more common then they should be and can kill a match or two. I like the way the game plays and all but its ruined by so many people."
2053,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"This game used to be fun, but unfortunately it became unusual to play in a game where my team was not against a smurf, deranker, or hacker. Also, hitreg is still an issue and probably always will be. If you're new to this game, get out while you still can."
2054,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"This game isn't fun, and the entire premise behind it is as a gaping cash-vacuum leading straight down valve's greed-thirsty throats. I would rather watch paint dry, but sadly they took that off the steam store."
2055,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,Sadly this game isn't fun for me anymore still 64tick servers for Competitive matchmaking. I only see russians who either cheat or are not able to use a mouse properly in my team even when i'm playing with Prime mates.The gameplay hasn't improved in quiet a while the only new things are Operations with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps and new skins that wouldn't even impress a 12 yrs old.
2056,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Alright, don't get me wrong, this is a fun game if you like high intensity and realistic gameplay. My opinion, however, is that this game's competitive ranking system is total garbage. Now before you go on raging in the replies saying ""ERMAGURD GO BACK TO COD MAD CUZ BAD GET GUD LUL"" please read the following.This system is poorly designed because you constantly have to be paired with good teams in order to win games and thus rank up in your competitive rank. For the uneducated, the more games you win, the more likeley you are to rank up, but if you lose games, you lose your rank. When you are constantly being paired with people who don't have microphones or toxic squeakers who don't know what they're doing, you derank all the way to silver one. The non comeptitive rank literally means nothing and is just there to look nice, which in my opinion should determine which skill group you're in for competitve, but nope. The system Valve built requires you to get lucky and be paired with a decent team that can communicate easily and knows what they're doing, which won't happen unless the planets align during a full moon.So if you don't want to constantly grind competitive matches and face a toxic community filled with tryhards and squeakers, don't download this game."
2057,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2015,"I love it10/10You need skill! No powerups, you need to master everything about it.Economy, aim, movement, teamwork are just few of the many things you need to master.But the hitboxes, pistols and anti-cheat could use a bit of tweaking.One of, if not THE most skill-based games."
2058,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"Amazing game, valve's finest.  Pros:The weapons and maps are relatively balanced, it runs better and easier than most 1st person shooters, plus it has customizable weapon skins (purchasable and unlockable) and a extremely large community full of amazing weapon and map creations.Cons:-Hackers-Smurfs-The autos (GS3G1 and Scar-20)-Comp without prime matchmaking-Naive Children-Griefers-The Current Rank System-Vac's obliviousness to cheatersConclusion:Obviously Valve can't fix all of these problems, and most of them are liveable so there really isn't a need. But is CSGO a good game, and should you buy it? Yes, it is a good game and while it does have it's downsides valve will occasionlly fix the big problems. Helping it's playerbase from just ragequiting the game all together. But is it worth your money? It really depends on how commited you get to fps's because I garantee you, this one takes far more time to master than any other shooter you've played before (excluding maybe insurgency or more realistic hardcore FPS games). So if you're willing to put the time in, for an hour or two of fun every night, then yes, this game is for you and I emplore you to get it."
2059,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,The new Update is stupid!- CSGO for free- More hackers as before the update- Cheap battle royal modeSeit neuen Update einfach nur dumm:- CSGO kostenlos- Hacker (mehr als vorher)- Billiger Battleroyalmodus
2060,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2018,"soo battle royale community huh ?damn u valve, u make this ssshit free now??! i waste money and now u make it free? dumb as hell...UPDATE. after i try playing battle royale mode... cheaters everywhere! aimbot, wallhackk etc. and idiots cheaters just only need 1 or 2 shoots to kill u wtf ... ridiculousvalve isnt faking care about cheatersmake it free = cheaters invasion"
2061,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"I tried to enjoy this game but I could just not get into it.  I might play it in the future but with the toxic community I just can't seem to get myself to enjoy it, now yes I do suck at the game but that is not why I am giving this game a thumbs down.  I just don't like the community and I just get bored of the game all in all I don't recommend this game to anyone who wants to be in a toxic community, But I do rocommend this game to people who like face pased FPS which I do of course just not this game."
2062,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2017,"I don't play this game anymore. It just wasn't any fun anymore, because too many Cheater, Smurfer and Flamer. The Matchmaking is horrible.... smurfer made a major contribution to this. "
2063,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"Well, after 500+ hours spend in this game when i realized that i never really enjoyed playing it. I played it only because everybody around me was playing it but facts didn't let me play it anymore. Facts:1. I spend HUNDREDS if not thousands of euros simply by gambling with skins. This game got me addicted to gambling. I already played poker in casino and stuff but i never felt that i need to go back there again until now. 2. Community is so toxic that you need to completely ignore it in order to play the game. Muting everyone except people you know in real life was always needed in this game. 3. Recent ranking system update. In this update valve let people feel how bad they are. If you let somebody achieve third best rank in game it means he is good and then you just send him back somewhere between mid-ranked people just because he didnt played the game for few weeks. Its insane how valve is forcing people to play they're games in last few weeks. 4. Overwatch: Now this one is an example of BIG MISTAKE. You cant just give other player ability to perma ban you. But valve gave this ability to gold novas (7-12 years olds). I decided to do a bit of experiment: I deranked my account all the way to gold and started smurfing. As i expected kids were accusing me of cheating all the time. Also i handed OVERWATCH BAN which is displayed on my profile until today. I wrote message to steam support and they dont look like they give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Banning innocent players. This is final nail in csgo's coffin."
2064,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,2016,"No! Jist, no. Now, you may ask, after 1600hrs of CS:GO, why I don't recommend this game? It's obvious that is not about the gameplay. CS:GO as any of the CS games has, one of the most addictive and challenging gameplay ever. Technically the game is perfect: good graphics, fast respond updates to bugs and problems. One of the best anti-cheat systems in the world. Yep, better than Blizzard's. (You may not agree with the sentence about the anti-cheats, but I will explain this down.) And, even the market for ""goods"" and DLCs is perfect. It's focused on the older and more experienced players. Lots of ""skins"" for the new players and new ""operations""(maps) for the older players. The more you play, the better this game becomes. Like I said, technically perfect on any aspect. The problem comes form the game community. You may agree with, that the most of the players in this game are 12 years old kids with urgent desire to sleep with your mother. And, after few hours with the game you will become a polyglot linguist, mostly in slavic phiology (Polish, Russian). But this aren't the main problem. The problem is in the COMPLETE tolerance, the COMPLETE ignorance and the COMPLETE lack of knowledge from the community, about the CHEATERS. This game possess one of the most complete anti-cheat systems. It covers every aspect of the game: VAC- automatic anti-cheat program, Overwatch system for precise observation. This two programs are in constant communication with the main game and the ""Matchmaking system""- so, all of the cheaters to end playing against each other and to get banned. But, ...BUT... This system relys on, the ""willingness"" of this community to use this system, to deal with the cheaters. Unfortunately, by this complete negligence the system is doing more damage to the people who are willing to help by using it. Rather than to the cheaters.If you are ""new"" to the game. My advice is to skip this game and don't start it."
