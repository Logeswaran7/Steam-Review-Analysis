# Steam-Review-Analysis
 Sentiment analysis is one of the major topics in natural language processing. 
 The following process will provide the complete process of sentiment analysis of steam using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk). 
 The process consists of preparing the data followed by removing useless data like punctuations and symbols along with the removal of stopwords. 
 The processed data is then tokenized where the data is converted into tokens which allows us to compare different words in the reviews. 
 Stemming is done after tokenization to merge similar words in the data. At last, we calculate TF, IDF, and TFIDF for the following data.
 All these steps allow us to analyze the data to identify whether the game has overall positive or negative feedback.
